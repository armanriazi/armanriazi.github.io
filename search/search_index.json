Leveraging over a decade of experience transitioning from software development to cybersecurity, I bring a nuanced perspective to aligning technical precision with business imperatives. My role as a strategic advisor focuses on helping forward-thinking organizations\u2014particularly technology-driven startups\u2014craft evidence-based security plans that address real-world risks while enabling scalability.  </p> <p>By employing approaches rooted in Security Chaos Engineering and decision-tree modeling of adverse scenarios, I empower companies to proactively secure their digital ecosystems. My deep understanding of the cybersecurity marketplace allows me to assist organizations in decoding buyer behaviors, prioritizing user trust, identifying competitive dynamics, and adapting to shifts in industry trends.</p> <p>For instance, as a Cybersecurity Architect, I successfully designed secure, scalable solutions like microservices platforms and APIs for high-demand systems, achieving a 5% cost reduction while driving 9% customer growth. My strategic work is also bolstered by my contributions to cybersecurity research, including publishing papers on topics such as Cloud Computing, Blockchain, and Ransomware Detection Systems, as well as authoring a book titled \"Rust as a Modern Mother Lang: Advanced Techniques for Developing Robust Apps.\"</p>"},{"location":"services/#consulting-engagements","title":"Consulting Engagements","text":"<p>I specialize in actionable, scalable cybersecurity consulting services for software engineering, IT, and security teams.

<p>talks so not very much is is is ready in</p> <p>that regard it's really meant to be a</p> <p>workshop for kind of rough coding I</p> <p>wanted to get some people whoever</p> <p>brought their laptop sort of up to speed</p> <p>maybe get substrate downloaded and built</p> <p>and sort of take take people through</p> <p>maybe deploying deploying a new chain</p> <p>maybe writing some modules Sergei here</p> <p>is going to sort of give some give a</p> <p>demonstration of how to deploy a smart</p> <p>contract on our smart contract based</p> <p>substrate base smart contract chain so</p> <p>yeah don't expect too much hand holding</p> <p>on this what else yeah I figured</p> <p>actually I would put it to the audience</p> <p>what it is that you would prefer to see</p> <p>and do do like remember that you know if</p> <p>you say ah we'd like to see a new</p> <p>substrate module being done or I'd like</p> <p>to see how you develop the UI or how I</p> <p>would see something else it is gonna be</p> <p>me sort of bashing away on a keyboard</p> <p>for 85% at the time and if you don't</p> <p>have a keyboard to bash away with</p> <p>in-concert then it's it's going to be</p> <p>pretty boring but feel free to to ask me</p> <p>to demonstrate or sort of educate on</p> <p>what substrate does and how it works and</p> <p>I'll try and use my now freshly compiled</p> <p>substrate code base to help</p> <p>help explain any so any any requests no</p> <p>requests yep</p> <p>Adrian I certainly car would be my</p> <p>greatest pleasure to you to walk through</p> <p>and anything beyond walking through</p> <p>JavaScript's sorry walking through</p> <p>substrate models in JavaScript yeah sure</p> <p>okay</p> <p>sure yep</p> <p>that's gonna be a month or two before we</p> <p>we've already done over that but yeah</p> <p>you can expect that in the new year it's</p> <p>good that Rob's not here otherwise you</p> <p>might meet cringing right now sure yeah</p> <p>okay I guess there's a few things there</p> <p>to be working on okay let's start with</p> <p>the the last question because that's the</p> <p>one I can remember the easiest so if we</p> <p>if we had to depart the code base is</p> <p>this can you actually read that or</p> <p>should i zoom in a bit better or some</p> <p>more yeah okay cause like the more i</p> <p>zoom the less the less easier for me</p> <p>it's gonna be boring it can also make</p> <p>more space are a horizontal space yeah</p> <p>okay cool yeah so a you TXO model it's</p> <p>an interesting sort of one and one that</p> <p>we have just about begun prototyping in</p> <p>parity we've got a team of like two or</p> <p>three people working on it basically the</p> <p>bitcoin style you</p>"},{"location":"todo/#utxo-model","title":"UTXO model","text":"<p>is kind of an interesting hybrid between the</p> <p>stripped/stricked all full nodes must validate</p> <p>everything and and base their validation</p> <p>they the things that they validate sort</p> <p>of they put a state route/root a storage</p> <p>route if you like state route into each</p> <p>block header and that means that like</p> <p>clients when they come along they can</p> <p>actually in principle validate</p> <p>everything all of the state transition</p> <p>logic of every block based purely upon</p> <p>the state route of the last block right</p> <p>so if you trust that the header of the</p> <p>last block is something or other then</p> <p>you can check that state route and you</p> <p>can come you can be provided with a</p> <p>proof that all of the transactions on</p> <p>the current block where executed</p> <p>correctly and therefore that the state</p> <p>route on the current block is is correct</p> <p>and polka dot very much uses this model</p> <p>it's the model that the power chains are</p> <p>based around and it basically means that</p> <p>validators by having just like client</p> <p>logic can actually validate every power</p> <p>chain equally</p> <p>I'm bitcoins a little different in</p> <p>principle if you trust the previous</p> <p>blocks header you can still be provided</p> <p>with a proof that the current block is</p> <p>valid but the proof is potentially all</p> <p>of the Bitcoin blockchain and therefore</p> <p>not super concise this it's this is the</p> <p>case because Bitcoin doesn't keep a</p> <p>track of the current state at every</p> <p>block and place that in the header as a</p> <p>cryptographic hash rather when you want</p> <p>to so make some transaction on Bitcoin</p> <p>and prove that it's a valid transaction</p> <p>you use unspent transaction outputs and</p> <p>those are outputs that it is expected</p> <p>that nodes will record in their database</p> <p>but if you want the actual proof that</p> <p>those outputs are valid you have to go</p> <p>all the way back to the block where they</p> <p>were they were the outputs from a spend</p> <p>in order to be sure that that they're</p> <p>legit and obviously you have to see the</p> <p>entire chain between now and then in</p> <p>order to be sure that they weren't spent</p> <p>already so it's it's much harder to do a</p> <p>you TXO model in literally the same vein</p> <p>as Bitcoin because this kind of light</p> <p>client sort of model doesn't doesn't</p> <p>quite extend to the conciseness theorems</p> <p>does that said if you instead store the</p> <p>unspent transaction outputs in a murkily</p> <p>structure in the same way that aetherium</p> <p>stores its contract state then you are</p> <p>able to basically get a hash of that</p> <p>structure every block and you can you</p> <p>can provide concise proofs that a</p> <p>particular transaction is valid because</p> <p>you can see the you can demonstrate that</p> <p>those and spent transaction outputs</p> <p>appear in this localized structure and</p> <p>that's how we would implement a u TXO</p> <p>style chain within the para chain model</p> <p>and probably how we would implement it</p> <p>in substrate and that's actually going</p> <p>forward how its</p> <p>we built in principle though as I said</p> <p>that you could introduce a raw database</p> <p>into substrate and actually mimic</p> <p>bitcoins model but it would preclude</p> <p>turning it into a para chain without</p> <p>adding some additional layers of</p> <p>indirection and likely are not likely</p> <p>enough trust which we're not so keen on</p> <p>introducing programmatically speaking</p> <p>you'd introduce a UT EXO's at if we go</p> <p>into the code base so I mentioned before</p> <p>like substrate has three levels of kind</p> <p>of you can dive into substrate of three</p> <p>levels so you can dive into at the core</p> <p>which is right there oh and this is if</p> <p>you use substrate you use substrate core</p> <p>and it's got all of the things that you</p> <p>would expect to see in a in a block</p> <p>chain if we look at the modules or the</p> <p>crates as Arista falls them then we you</p> <p>know you can see things like the</p> <p>consensus and the finality and the</p> <p>keystore and the networking and the our</p> <p>PCs and so forth</p> <p>it would likely be implemented as a</p> <p>outside of the SRM L so the SRM L is</p> <p>here because the SRM L is rather</p> <p>designed around a an account and an</p> <p>index model similar to aetherium in</p> <p>principle you could nonetheless create</p> <p>some additional SRM l modules that kind</p> <p>of introduce you to EXO's I mean in</p> <p>principle as modules of turing-complete</p> <p>they've got entry point functions that</p> <p>can be arbitrary bodies and they've got</p> <p>they can they can do basically anything</p> <p>with storage that they want so there's</p> <p>no reason that you couldn't implement it</p> <p>that way but it'd probably be a bit more</p> <p>efficient and make a bit more sense</p> <p>if you implement it as its own runtime</p> <p>and to do it as its own runtime you</p> <p>would basically just</p> <p>use the underlying abstractions in core</p> <p>that were used in order to pass in order</p> <p>to allow things like the execute block</p> <p>function to be to be implemented and for</p> <p>it to be called into by the the rest of</p> <p>the client and and work with that</p> <p>directly and you define your own block</p> <p>format and your own transaction format</p> <p>and in general build the execute block</p> <p>function and that's in Bitcoin from from</p> <p>scratch where as I say parity is is</p> <p>pushing forward with its with a you TXO</p> <p>chain mostly so partly to make sure that</p> <p>the model that we have is actually</p> <p>general it's it's a good sort of sanity</p> <p>check and partly because we actually</p> <p>want to introduce a payment based system</p> <p>that's that's a sorry a payment system</p> <p>that's based around you TX owes and</p> <p>potentially that has some sort of ZK</p> <p>snark functionality in as well and we're</p> <p>doing that with the by reusing as much</p> <p>of the PBGC block parity Bitcoin and</p> <p>code bases become cool I'm not going to</p> <p>start implementing one here am i okay</p> <p>maybe laters cool</p> <p>what were the other three questions</p> <p>theorem compatibility yeah so how does</p> <p>the RPC RPC and JavaScript work this is</p> <p>a yeah this is an interesting question</p> <p>so substrates meant to be pretty generic</p> <p>and if we go to the RBC module it's</p> <p>split into four four sub sub modules</p> <p>author chain state and system author is</p> <p>to do with block authoring and it</p> <p>contains have a look what it contains</p> <p>submit</p> <p>extrinsic there's a couple formats you</p> <p>can submit them in and a Ana pub/sub to</p> <p>let you watch what's happening with</p> <p>those extrinsic s-- so if you actually</p> <p>want to inter inter oh if you want to</p> <p>communicate with substrate through the</p> <p>AH feces then these are the RPC is</p> <p>you're going to use and it's basically</p> <p>like here's an extrinsic it's already</p> <p>signed it's already done and dusted just</p> <p>submit it broadcast it whatever and let</p> <p>me know how it goes and you from this</p> <p>you'll get back various messages I think</p> <p>I know they were on the have a look</p> <p>maybe I've got some messages yeah I</p> <p>don't</p> <p>you'll get various messages to tell you</p> <p>that it's been validated that it's been</p> <p>broadcast that or that it's about to be</p> <p>broadcast that it's been broadcast and</p> <p>that it's been finalized or if it</p> <p>doesn't get finalized if something else</p> <p>gets finalized in its place and that</p> <p>it's now been dumped then you'll be</p> <p>again told that it's been okay so back</p> <p>to substrate 101 yes right to make to</p> <p>make substrate be as general as possible</p> <p>we didn't want to introduce data into</p> <p>the block header that may not be in</p> <p>every block chain that substrate that</p> <p>need not be in every block chain that</p> <p>substrate is gonna cater for rather we</p> <p>want to make the header strictly the</p> <p>information that is required for</p> <p>substrate and the rest of the rest of</p> <p>the information that might otherwise go</p> <p>into a header in normal block chains for</p> <p>example the timestamp instead is</p> <p>provided under a separate model that's</p> <p>outside of the header called the</p> <p>extrinsic and extrinsic just mean that</p> <p>it's like data that is extrinsic to the</p> <p>block chain so it's not it's not</p> <p>intrinsic to the chain</p> <p>it's not like part of its state or</p> <p>anything like that it's not a previous</p> <p>transaction or anything that it can draw</p> <p>upon directly but rather it's just data</p> <p>from the external world is extrinsic to</p> <p>the chain and so data from the external</p> <p>world is provided in this set of of</p> <p>snippets of pieces and each piece is</p> <p>called extra and extrinsic and it's just</p> <p>short for a piece of extra piece of data</p> <p>extrinsic to the chain so right so</p> <p>specifically the transactions that are</p> <p>coming in coming in from the external</p> <p>world they are indeed extrinsic</p> <p>so most block chains possibly all</p> <p>require there they're sort of</p> <p>transactions to be signed like they have</p> <p>a particular signature scheme and if</p> <p>they're not signed or if the signatures</p> <p>wrong then they'll never be considered</p> <p>they won't even make it into the system</p> <p>substrates a bit different so substrate</p> <p>says extrinsic scan there are perfectly</p> <p>valid extrinsic s-- that are not signed</p> <p>they're extrinsic the only thing special</p> <p>about them is that they're a bit of data</p> <p>and they come with some way of</p> <p>determining their length upfront so you</p> <p>you know you can pass them around on the</p> <p>network without worrying how long they</p> <p>are other than that they're they're just</p> <p>arbitrary bits of data they may be</p> <p>signed they may include a signature they</p> <p>may include a multi-sig they may not it</p> <p>doesn't really matter some pieces of</p> <p>data for example the timestamp so</p> <p>there's literal okay I can think of very</p> <p>easy Taric ways how you might possibly</p> <p>argue that a timestamp could be signed</p> <p>and that would make it valid like maybe</p> <p>if the the what's at the atoll the guys</p> <p>are on the atomic clocks like maybe</p> <p>signed it with one of the keys but still</p> <p>someone could steal the keys and then</p> <p>the signature it doesn't make it</p> <p>specifically valid nothing can make a</p> <p>timestamp specifically valid right it's</p> <p>a piece of data from the external world</p> <p>and the only thing that means a time</p> <p>star</p> <p>is correct as if we all agree that it's</p> <p>correct what time is it right now well I</p> <p>can say well it's 38 minutes past 6:00</p> <p>in the evening but it's if your watch</p> <p>says that it's 37 minutes past 6:00 then</p> <p>you know there is no way how without</p> <p>like finding a shared Authority there's</p> <p>no way how we can argue that one is more</p> <p>correct than another and certainly</p> <p>signing it isn't going to help all three</p> <p>authors just an arbitrary name that we</p> <p>call when we say author we just mean</p> <p>block author so this is a block</p> <p>authoring API this is an a this is an</p> <p>RPC that you use when you want to</p> <p>interact with the bit of substrate that</p> <p>is authoring blocks and this is actually</p> <p>incorrectly named it's very good that</p> <p>you brought it up it shouldn't be called</p> <p>extrinsic s-- or at least it's it's it's</p> <p>a little over general to call the</p> <p>extrinsic the only extrinsic that you</p> <p>can submit using this API are</p> <p>specifically signed extrinsic because</p> <p>it's coming from the RPC and therefore</p> <p>you have no other way other than looking</p> <p>for a signature to know that it's</p> <p>anything that's really sensible unsigned</p> <p>extrinsic switch for what it's worth we</p> <p>call inherence because they are we treat</p> <p>them as being inherently valid are are</p> <p>generated within substrate so extrinsic</p> <p>s-- is information that come from the</p> <p>outside of substrate and inherent are</p> <p>our extrinsic that come from within</p> <p>substrate and sorry transactions really</p> <p>come from the outside inherent come from</p> <p>with them they're both forms of</p> <p>extrinsic because they're both forms of</p> <p>data that can be introduced to the</p> <p>blockchain and that might make some</p> <p>sense to the runtime now if you don't if</p> <p>you don't sign some data then it's like</p> <p>well</p> <p>you know how does that how does that</p> <p>possibly work you know data's not signed</p> <p>then it could be anything right and the</p> <p>way that it works is the validators so</p> <p>the guys that basically say that this</p> <p>block is valid are the ones that get to</p> <p>be opinionated over whether this data is</p> <p>sensible or not and that's actually how</p> <p>this works in other blockchains as well</p> <p>so if you look to aetherium if the time</p> <p>stamp is actually just an opinion right</p> <p>a validator when they validate an</p> <p>aetherium block have an opinion over</p> <p>whether this time stamp is sensible or</p> <p>not and if it's not sensible they ignore</p> <p>the block they unilaterally decide to</p> <p>ignore the block and in in that sense</p> <p>substrate is equivalent in its treatment</p> <p>of inherent if a is up to a validator</p> <p>when they're proposing the block to put</p> <p>in sensible inherence and if they don't</p> <p>put in sensible inherence if there's</p> <p>inherent in correct or incorrect in the</p> <p>opinion of the other validators then</p> <p>their block will be considered useless</p> <p>and won't get any further attention so</p> <p>it's up to them to put in sensible</p> <p>values for the inherent extrinsic that</p> <p>are required by the block and this</p> <p>basically means that we can do all sorts</p> <p>of interesting stuff aside from time</p> <p>stamps I mean time stamps are the first</p> <p>use but we can do things like for</p> <p>example with para chained candidates for</p> <p>the polkadot relay chain there are</p> <p>that's another form of inherence why</p> <p>because which candidates you choose in</p> <p>order to in order to to be to be</p> <p>therefore finalizing is necessarily an</p> <p>opinion right it's different validators</p> <p>might choose different para chained</p> <p>candidate blocks to be finalized for</p> <p>that particular relay chain block</p> <p>there's no way of deterministic elite</p> <p>oozing the correct set of these guys</p> <p>it's just whichever ones happen to come</p> <p>come by you but if you put forward</p> <p>blocks that the other validators on the</p> <p>relay chain think are invalid perhaps</p> <p>pick</p> <p>they don't have the Associated data</p> <p>because there's no data availability for</p> <p>them or just perhaps because they're</p> <p>empty perhaps because they they just</p> <p>haven't seen them before whatever reason</p> <p>it is if they don't think that your</p> <p>opinion is is a good one over the</p> <p>selection of these blocks and they're</p> <p>free to ignore you in reality you know</p> <p>they'd have to be quite malevolent</p> <p>before they do ignore valid blocks</p> <p>because they get paid basically for</p> <p>passing these things but by and large</p> <p>it's up to the validators to self-police</p> <p>the content of the inherent transactions</p> <p>the the sorry the inherent extrinsic s--</p> <p>for the transaction extrinsic s-- there</p> <p>they are per se valid or invalid like</p> <p>you can check whether a transaction is</p> <p>valid by virtue of does it have a good</p> <p>signature and whatever account has</p> <p>signed it does it have enough funds at</p> <p>this point in order to pay for the the</p> <p>cost for it to be placed on chain and if</p> <p>those two answers are yes then it's all</p> <p>good and that's the difference between</p> <p>the two so this is the RPC for how you</p> <p>can submit them unlike aetherium we</p> <p>don't provide any account management</p> <p>stuff in here so what you can't do is</p> <p>provide is try and get it to sign in and</p> <p>to sign a transaction all of the signing</p> <p>happens external to the node so the node</p> <p>is minimal</p> <p>we do very well noticed the keystore</p> <p>package is there specifically for for</p> <p>block authors so far the validator nodes</p> <p>just stored their their block authoring</p> <p>keys so basically when you when you set</p> <p>up a node as a validator node which so I</p> <p>got away without doing this on the on</p> <p>the demo that I gave earlier by using</p> <p>the - - dev option which is shorthand</p>"},{"location":"todo/#for-chain-equals-dev-validator","title":"for - - chain equals dev - - validator","text":"<ul> <li>key Alice but I could have typed   those</li> </ul> <p>in and it would have done the same thing</p> <p>and so when you pass it the key it will</p> <p>it will use that it will basically put</p> <p>that key into the the key store and then</p> <p>if it notices a key in the keystore is</p> <p>one of the validators and it's set to</p> <p>being a validator it will actually start</p> <p>signing what and and join in with the</p> <p>consensus so that's the key store is</p> <p>really just there for the for managing</p> <p>validators keys for consensus yeah I can</p> <p>see yeah so there'll be some shims or</p> <p>middleware in order to manage some of</p> <p>this some of these are pcs to make to</p> <p>make it compatible now I'll go into I'll</p> <p>go because this is kind of an</p> <p>interesting exploration I think so there</p> <p>are a few other modules chain does</p> <p>pretty much what you'd expect it to do</p> <p>it's it's about blocks and headers it</p> <p>lets you get transactions and as I have</p> <p>been chatting to a meal over the last</p> <p>few weeks and months the the point of a</p> <p>substrate node isn't to provide a</p> <p>generic sort of very generalized</p> <p>database for every all of your uses that</p> <p>you might have I mean etherium was kind</p> <p>of pushing in that direction we provided</p> <p>all sorts of lookups that we didn't</p> <p>really have to substrate keeps it</p> <p>minimal it's it's got a fairly you know</p> <p>that's one of its Maxim's of design and</p> <p>one of the ways that we keep it so one</p> <p>of the ways that this sort of minimal</p> <p>RPC comes out is the fact that you can't</p> <p>look up specific transaction hashes you</p> <p>can I think maybe get oh yes so you can</p> <p>get a block and the block will come with</p> <p>a bunch of extrinsic sand in those</p> <p>extrinsic will be the transactions and</p> <p>that's that's basically if you want to</p> <p>index if you want to have a you know get</p> <p>so get a transaction by its hash</p> <p>you're gonna have to go to a chain</p> <p>Explorer or a</p> <p>party service provider or whatever to</p> <p>get that now you can verify that that</p> <p>that's the case just by getting the</p> <p>block and transaction index and then</p> <p>going back to your node and using this</p> <p>RPC to get that block and then lookup</p> <p>that index in the extrinsic and you'll</p> <p>find your transaction or not but we're</p> <p>not going to do that indexing for you</p> <p>because it's too much work it's it's</p> <p>better done on a dedicated software yeah</p> <p>sure</p> <p>i-i'm sure or are all of the author and</p> <p>other extrinsic s-- you mean the entire</p> <p>chains worth</p> <p>if the blocks not created yet then you</p> <p>can't look it up at all when it's when</p> <p>the blocks being executed no no no so</p> <p>either the block has has made its way</p> <p>into the database it's finalized then</p> <p>it's good or you can't you can't read it</p> <p>at all during what sorry execution of</p> <p>the block or well when a block executes</p> <p>I can show you that that that code but</p> <p>basically there's an execute block</p> <p>function and it gets given you get given</p> <p>a bunch of bytes and it's up to you to</p> <p>execute those bytes so at the lowest</p> <p>level so at core a core level yes SR ml</p> <p>it's a lot easier but that that's full</p> <p>of a lot of opinionation that isn't</p> <p>necessarily indicative of your chain</p> <p>that you're writing on substrate</p> <p>yeah yeah you just get given a bunch of</p> <p>bytes and that's your block and it's up</p> <p>to you to interpret the look of the</p> <p>block as you as you desire okay let me</p> <p>let me go through the are pcs and I'll</p> <p>come back to you so yeah we can get</p> <p>header block block hash and there's also</p> <p>a runtime version that should actually</p> <p>be in state but it was a very late</p> <p>edition Thank You Tomic Thank You Tomic</p> <p>we have system which just gives you a</p> <p>bunch of information about the system</p> <p>just the name version and the chain</p> <p>that's basically just the the current</p> <p>running node for example we also have</p> <p>the JavaScript implementation of much of</p> <p>substrate and that will return different</p> <p>things from from these are PCs finally</p> <p>as the state this is the most</p> <p>interesting thing so again back in if we</p> <p>if we think about what you can query of</p> <p>a block of a blockchain state in other</p> <p>block chains usually it's like account</p> <p>balances whether an output is is spent</p> <p>or not how much is sitting there</p> <p>potentially some state of a contract you</p> <p>might even be able to make a call into a</p> <p>contract and have it execute we're a bit</p> <p>lower level with substrate as as might</p> <p>be imagined from the fact this is a</p> <p>library with a framework with which you</p> <p>build block chains but there are things</p> <p>that you can get from the current state</p> <p>of the chain are storage so we have at</p> <p>the moment this RPC reflects a single</p> <p>storage database so basically we have a</p> <p>merkel Merkel tree there is of arbitrary</p> <p>size keys and Val</p> <p>in pairs right so the tree itself stores</p> <p>basically any key value any set of key</p> <p>value pairs and the root is stored as</p> <p>the state root and that goes into every</p> <p>block as you change the storage as we</p> <p>change these keys and values then you</p> <p>can that that will obviously change the</p> <p>state and you can make it's very handy</p> <p>for building pair of chains because you</p> <p>can make very clear like client proofs</p> <p>that one particular block with one state</p> <p>given these transactions that executed</p> <p>or these extrinsic sigh should say that</p> <p>executed left another particular block</p> <p>with another particular State</p> <p>that's nothing nothing no really not</p> <p>really any different to how etherium</p> <p>works the main difference is that of</p> <p>generalization and with our road map</p> <p>that allow where we want to build</p> <p>multiple different cryptographic</p> <p>databases so if we if we think of the</p> <p>Merc alized</p> <p>key value storage that we have here as a</p> <p>one example of a cryptographic database</p> <p>then we want to actually extend this to</p> <p>other cryptographic databases and also</p> <p>add a a means of having many of them at</p> <p>the same time so if you're familiar with</p> <p>how aetherium works there is a every</p> <p>smart contract actually has its own sort</p> <p>of cryptographic database where it</p> <p>stores its key value pairs it's storage</p> <p>if you like and and then there's one</p> <p>sort of big one that all of these other</p> <p>the by virtue of them having state</p> <p>routes all of these other databases hang</p> <p>off substrate only has one but it's one</p> <p>very general one and in principle though</p> <p>that can now be expanded to have as many</p> <p>as as is desired and they can even be of</p> <p>different types and they can be</p> <p>dynamically added and removed in the</p> <p>similar way to that you would</p> <p>dynamically add and remove them in a</p> <p>theory and when smart contracts go in</p> <p>and out of existence</p> <p>we also have metadata which is a</p> <p>wonderful wonderful RPC that I will</p> <p>spend some time talking about when I</p> <p>address one of the other questions which</p> <p>was the color JavaScript</p> <p>sort of magically works and finally we</p> <p>have a pub sub for storage so you can</p> <p>subscribe to particular storage items</p> <p>and you can get notifications when those</p> <p>storage items change so if you</p> <p>understand how storage works and that's</p> <p>one of the other magical things about</p> <p>metadata that's what it kind of provides</p> <p>that's what it partly provides then you</p> <p>can basically keep an eye on that</p> <p>storage and just be notified when that</p> <p>entry changes yeah so Sergei can go into</p> <p>how smart contracts so this this little</p> <p>symposium will be will be split so I'll</p> <p>answer whatever sort of more general</p> <p>questions about substrate and then</p> <p>Sergey is going to do a little sort of</p> <p>walkthrough of deploying a smart</p> <p>contracting because explain some of the</p> <p>technicals behind the smart contracts</p> <p>and we can go into the events and and</p> <p>smart contract storage there this is</p> <p>specifically for substrate chains as a</p> <p>whole and this will be very likely look</p> <p>like the final RPC an API for para</p> <p>chains so with smart contract so we have</p> <p>a smart contract module and that exists</p> <p>as a module within substrates SR ml so</p> <p>you can basically make a substrate chain</p> <p>that can can manage smart contracts as</p> <p>well as do a bunch of other things like</p> <p>have governance and all the rest of it</p> <p>so we we kind of see smart contracts as</p> <p>a piece of functionality that you can</p> <p>answer your chain or not add to your</p> <p>chain as you see fit the</p> <p>on your use case some use cases that</p> <p>require a generalized sort of smart</p> <p>contract environment some a very sort of</p> <p>specific fixed-function chains and if</p> <p>their specific fixed function chains</p> <p>then like for example a plasma chain a</p> <p>plasma chain doesn't require a smart</p> <p>contract modules and these smart</p> <p>contracts in there right it's a fixed</p> <p>function chain that would that basically</p> <p>manages all of the other chains hanging</p> <p>off it and what to do if those chains</p> <p>want to do an early termination or or</p> <p>settle on the upper layer so I don't</p> <p>imagine all chains to have smart</p> <p>contracts from finality in fact I</p> <p>suspect many chain even perhaps a</p> <p>majority of chains won't have smart</p> <p>contract functionality</p> <p>there'll be they'll settle for having</p> <p>fixed function fixed pipe fixed block</p> <p>processing functionality that's</p> <p>upgradeable we like up readability cool</p> <p>so that's that's basically the our pcs</p> <p>now the interesting thing is how these</p> <p>interact with the JavaScript environment</p> <p>so we're developing because we like to</p> <p>give people Choice we're developing</p> <p>multiple JavaScript API is to interact</p> <p>with substrate and substrate modules</p> <p>now these api's are primarily geared</p> <p>towards interacting with the substrate</p> <p>runtime module library the SRM l so they</p> <p>are fairly their highest level right</p> <p>there are lower level components like</p> <p>for example you can use these pub subs</p> <p>with promises I believe at the</p> <p>JavaScript level but if you want to but</p> <p>we make it easy for you to use to build</p> <p>applications based around custom modules</p> <p>that you code in the SRM so you got a</p> <p>taste of that although it might have</p> <p>sort of flown past you a little bit in</p> <p>the demo because that was trying to get</p> <p>it all finished and more or less on time</p> <p>but I don't know if you noticed but when</p> <p>I wrote that that little sort of toy the</p> <p>I was able to interact with the toy in</p> <p>the browser as soon as the chain had</p> <p>been upgraded I actually in the console</p> <p>got like an object that that let me do</p> <p>it in like that was specific to them the</p> <p>code that I'd literally just written in</p> <p>rusty now I that wasn't a trick I didn't</p> <p>have anything up my sleeves it was it</p> <p>was literally that cool what happened</p> <p>was the runtime got upgraded although I</p> <p>didn't code any new JavaScript stuff</p> <p>what the the code that I wrote and</p> <p>annoyingly I can't really I don't have</p> <p>know let me see if I can find that code</p> <p>should be in substrate node template and</p> <p>if I remember correctly I might even</p> <p>have to I do okay so so if we go back to</p> <p>the substrate node template so this is</p> <p>this is the sort of demo node that I</p> <p>that I forked and started coding and I</p> <p>have this demo module and if you</p> <p>remember I did something like this I</p> <p>said I did post sender and then decoded</p> <p>this this little address and then also</p> <p>for the call</p> <p>it's calls demo dot set payment and that</p> <p>just worked despite me not actually</p> <p>having changed anything in the</p> <p>JavaScript</p> <p>I didn't even reload the page I think I</p> <p>certainly shouldn't have had to what</p> <p>happened was when I coded this module</p> <p>with play and set payment and when I</p> <p>coded this storage with the two entries</p> <p>here payment and pot part of this macro</p> <p>generates some metadata about what these</p> <p>functions are and what these storage</p> <p>items are and this includes the types</p> <p>this metadata is compiled into a sort of</p> <p>blob and then amalgamated with all the</p> <p>other metadata from all the other</p> <p>modules by virtue of this macro here</p> <p>construct runtime that you might have</p> <p>remembered I put the demo line in this</p> <p>then gets passed to through this macro</p> <p>which implements the api's into as a</p> <p>something that can be called into from</p> <p>the client so we have here one specific</p> <p>trait that we can implement called</p> <p>metadata as a metadata trait if we</p> <p>implement it it means that metadata RPC</p> <p>will work and what it will do is it will</p> <p>check to make sure it's actually</p> <p>implemented call into it which means</p> <p>dispatching into the newly compiled</p> <p>runtime that's been compiled into</p> <p>webassembly</p> <p>and interpreting this metadata and all</p> <p>this this this function does is it grabs</p> <p>the metadata from the runtime and that</p> <p>was caught that was built from this</p> <p>constructor and time and that was built</p> <p>from all of the individual modules which</p> <p>are each are built from their</p> <p>declarations of what they're stripped</p> <p>their storage are and what their what</p> <p>their module is that in terms of their</p> <p>function entry points and this gets</p> <p>passed into the JavaScript and as part</p> <p>of the substrate JavaScript libraries we</p> <p>have a couple of libraries that you can</p> <p>choose to use one is based on</p> <p>observables one is based on the bomb's</p> <p>framework that I did last year and these</p> <p>libraries will in interpret this</p> <p>metadata blob and turn into real</p> <p>JavaScript utility objects that reflect</p> <p>and</p> <p>[Music]</p> <p>and will dispatch to and utilize all of</p> <p>the all of the module specific stuff so</p> <p>if we go to the way they put it</p> <p>no just live demo yeah so if we go to</p> <p>demo then it will actually interpret</p> <p>will basically make Marshall all the</p> <p>arguments and dispatch it through the</p> <p>transaction dispatch system into yeah</p> <p>and similarly if we query what the pot</p> <p>is it will work out where this runtime</p> <p>given this this module stores the pot in</p> <p>its storage and then go into storage and</p> <p>check that using these storage are PCs</p> <p>and if you part of bonds is the fact</p> <p>that it's reactive so if you tie that</p> <p>into a reactive component if you</p> <p>remember at the end of the demo I very</p> <p>quickly did a little label that that</p> <p>tracked the pot going up and down what</p> <p>it's doing there is it's setting up a</p> <p>pub sub with the thing that it figured</p> <p>out all on its own with the storage</p> <p>location for pot and track the value it</p> <p>knew what the type was because it looked</p> <p>that to see that this pot type is T</p> <p>balanced and decoded it into a balanced</p> <p>type and then put that into a label</p> <p>formatted it correctly and put it on the</p> <p>screen and it did all of that without me</p> <p>really having to do anything other than</p> <p>implement it right here in rust so the</p> <p>idea with this is to make it not just</p> <p>painless but actually fun to code</p> <p>modules and the U is four modules what</p> <p>was one of the other that was another</p> <p>question mempool yes this is an</p> <p>interesting one so we rewrote the meant</p> <p>well</p> <p>Tomek I should say rewrote the mempool</p> <p>recently we call it the transaction pool</p> <p>same thing</p> <p>we wanted something that was general but</p> <p>also easy to use and it took a little</p> <p>bit of thought but what we came up with</p> <p>was a a pool that basically allows</p> <p>runtimes to specify dependency graphs</p> <p>arbitrary dependency graphs of</p> <p>transactions easily we wanted something</p> <p>that would work equally well between UT</p> <p>EXO model and a account and index model</p> <p>so basically a transaction pool that was</p> <p>equally viable to be used for something</p> <p>like Bitcoin and aetherium with the idea</p> <p>being that if we made something general</p> <p>enough for both of them it would</p> <p>probably be pretty general sufficiently</p> <p>at least for doing interesting other</p> <p>chains in the future so the way it</p> <p>basically works is the runtime gets</p> <p>queried and I can show you where this</p> <p>comes in the runtime gets queried</p> <p>through this validate transaction as</p> <p>part of a transaction Q trait so this is</p> <p>a trait that you have to implement in</p> <p>order for this transaction queue to work</p> <p>transaction pool actually just</p> <p>references the executive here so the</p> <p>executive is like a sort of overarching</p> <p>SRM L module that looks after just</p> <p>executing a block in general in</p> <p>particular it runs through each of the</p> <p>extrinsic and dispatches them off into</p> <p>the module that is expecting to that the</p> <p>extrinsic is sort of trying to call into</p> <p>all extrinsic in the SRM L framework</p> <p>have a they they may or may not have a</p> <p>sender they may or may not have a</p> <p>signature they may or may not have an</p> <p>index they may or may not have an error</p> <p>we actually allow we actually force or</p> <p>not force we actually facilitate</p> <p>extrinsic soar transactions to limit the</p> <p>number of blocks that they're valid for</p> <p>inherit</p> <p>right so you can make an extrinsic the</p> <p>transaction I should say that is valid</p> <p>for the 16 blocks between a thousand and</p> <p>twenty four and a thousand and forty</p> <p>right and it after a block a thousand</p> <p>and forty it's just no longer valid it</p> <p>can never possibly be make its way into</p> <p>a block chain this is needed for a bunch</p> <p>of other things particularly for having</p> <p>dust collection which I can go into</p> <p>after after I've talked about this if</p> <p>that's of interesting the transaction</p> <p>the way that the validate transaction</p> <p>thing works the important thing I want</p> <p>to show you is the inputs and the output</p> <p>so the inputs are the transaction fair</p> <p>enough</p> <p>the outputs are the trend is this</p> <p>transaction validity object let's see if</p> <p>I can find where this is defined this is</p> <p>basically a means of we see so we can</p> <p>see it's got like three potential states</p> <p>invalid valid or unknown l invalid oh no</p> <p>no and a pretty obvious what they mean</p> <p>valid so for a valid transaction we have</p> <p>a bunch of we have four sort of fields</p> <p>that we have to define priority so how</p> <p>what's this transactions priority</p> <p>amongst peers for which everything else</p> <p>is the same</p> <p>right so assuming this that everything</p> <p>else is is all other things being equal</p> <p>which one should we favor to put into a</p> <p>block for in aetherium style chain this</p> <p>would basically be what's the gas price</p> <p>if the gas price is higher then we just</p> <p>favorite more we also have requires and</p> <p>provide so requires is and we have this</p> <p>vector of transaction tags transaction</p> <p>tags are just Veck vu8 so in rust lack</p> <p>of UI it's basically just an arbitrary</p> <p>bunch of bytes right it's just a by the</p> <p>string yeah</p> <p>and these tanks they're therefore</p> <p>entirely up to the it's entirely up to</p> <p>the runtime how it what tags it uses it</p> <p>can tag them by hashes it could tighten</p> <p>them by integers it really doesn't</p> <p>matter could tag it by account IDs it</p> <p>could you know concatenate a bunch of</p> <p>these things and that could be the tag</p> <p>they're entirely arbitrary all that a</p> <p>transaction list transaction validity</p> <p>function has to state is what does it</p> <p>what tags does it require and what tanks</p> <p>does it provide now we can imagine for a</p> <p>for an aetherium style chain it would</p> <p>require the tags that requires are all</p> <p>of the tags actually let's start with</p> <p>the tax that it provides tags that</p> <p>provides our one tag that's formed by</p> <p>the concatenation of the account ID the</p> <p>sender ID and the current index the</p> <p>index of the transaction right the nonce</p> <p>yeah so you pop those two together</p> <p>that's your tag right that's just an</p> <p>identifier for the the thing that this</p> <p>transaction provides what it allows us</p> <p>to do is to then state what other</p> <p>transactions require in those terms so</p> <p>suppose you have a my transaction is</p> <p>sent from me my account dev and it's got</p> <p>an index of 10 right so for that to work</p> <p>in the etherium model there has to be a</p> <p>sent by me one with index 0 1 with index</p> <p>yeah and that would make 10 to be the</p> <p>next valid transaction so what it</p> <p>requires is all of those tags now that's</p> <p>a bit unwieldy for when we get into the</p> <p>thousands of or tens of thousands of</p> <p>transactions coming from a single</p> <p>account so what we say is only requires</p> <p>the tags that have not yet made their</p> <p>way onto the chain yeah and if if we get</p> <p>into the silly numbers like hundreds</p> <p>then we just say either unknown or</p> <p>invalid and we just say look this this</p> <p>transaction is just way ahead of</p> <p>schedule send it back sometime</p> <p>future and that that actually is more or</p> <p>less the way that the etherium the the</p> <p>parity etherium transaction queue sort</p> <p>of worked just not in these terms now if</p> <p>you're on a UT EXO chain then it's</p> <p>actually quite a bit easier because a UT</p> <p>EXO model like basically you've got what</p> <p>the tags are they're tags are just</p> <p>transaction output hashes yeah so your</p> <p>tags are it requires these unspent</p> <p>transactions or unspent transaction</p> <p>outputs so those transactions that are</p> <p>providing those outputs are specifically</p> <p>the things that are required and it</p> <p>provides well it provides its own hash</p> <p>its transaction hash so you can very</p> <p>quickly build a very easily build a</p> <p>dependency graph from aut EXO chain that</p> <p>fits the Maps quite fairly well on to</p> <p>this and we also have a longevity so</p> <p>longevity is basically it's valid now</p> <p>but for how many blocks will it continue</p> <p>to be valid in the future 4-bit Connor</p> <p>and aetherium that's infinity basically</p> <p>transactions don't become invalid just</p> <p>because time has passed but for for our</p> <p>substrate chains we have this notion as</p> <p>I said before of errors and the ability</p> <p>to inherently make a make a an extrinsic</p> <p>or a transaction in they're inherently</p> <p>invalid merely after the passing of time</p> <p>specifically blocks and that's what this</p> <p>sort of lets the transaction so yeah</p> <p>that's pretty much how transactions work</p> <p>in substrate this is more for the SR ml</p> <p>it is meant to be general so in theory</p> <p>it can be used perfectly easily from the</p> <p>core from if you want to build like your</p> <p>own from scratch substrate chain in</p> <p>principle this can be used fine but</p> <p>you're also free</p> <p>to write your own like there's there's</p> <p>nothing you can you can plug in your own</p> <p>cue if you want to write your own cue if</p> <p>you have something that this model can't</p> <p>can't manage to embed the nice thing</p> <p>about this though is that it goes to the</p> <p>runtime for all of its rules which means</p> <p>if you want to update your transaction</p> <p>formats and you want to introduce all</p> <p>sorts of new and crazy interesting stuff</p> <p>as long as you can put it in terms of</p> <p>priority requires provides and longevity</p> <p>then you can implement whatever it is</p> <p>that you want and when you upgrade the</p> <p>chain all of the full nodes all of the</p> <p>authoring nodes will all automatically</p> <p>use your new transaction semantics and</p> <p>they'll the transaction queues will</p> <p>function accordingly yep</p> <p>the only you can't modify so can you</p> <p>modify a transaction in the that's in</p> <p>the queue so what you can do is you can</p> <p>if a transaction has made its way into</p> <p>the queue because it said hey it's valid</p> <p>and you want another transaction to be</p> <p>able to to beat that one to it you know</p> <p>if the to a mutually one can you can</p> <p>make it mutually exclusive by by simply</p> <p>giving it the same tag but higher</p> <p>priority that will that will get the</p> <p>transaction kids are sort of boot it out</p> <p>the transaction queue only feeds</p> <p>transactions into the block if you just</p> <p>want a transaction to just become</p> <p>invalid before it's been finalized or</p> <p>before it's been before it makes its way</p> <p>into a block you can do that just as</p> <p>easily by having a sort of you know if</p> <p>in the execute block function if one of</p> <p>the transactions is this transaction</p> <p>then invalid block right and what will</p> <p>happen is the the unlucky guy who's</p> <p>using this transaction queue to to make</p> <p>a block will will find that adding this</p> <p>transaction makes their block invalid</p> <p>and</p> <p>and it's kind of bad form to do it that</p> <p>way you should try and like make it as</p> <p>much of a part of the queue as possible</p> <p>but if for whatever reason you can't do</p> <p>that then yeah you can make it invalid</p> <p>just by virtue of changing the runtime I</p> <p>get in the office</p> <p>Tomic can probably offer a little bit</p> <p>more insight into this basically</p> <p>priority is the is the first thing that</p> <p>it will select on and beyond that so for</p> <p>the transactions that have not yet</p> <p>become valid then basically it's just</p> <p>randomly choose randomly discarding</p> <p>one's not that random is is particularly</p> <p>great but it also minimizes any</p> <p>potential issues regarding censorship so</p> <p>if you've got like tons of nodes on the</p> <p>network and you really try to prevent</p> <p>some particular transaction from getting</p> <p>through and you're doing that just by</p> <p>spamming transaction out onto the</p> <p>transactions out onto the network we</p> <p>minimize the the worst case by by</p> <p>choosing transactions at random to</p> <p>discard because it's likely that</p> <p>eventually one node will eventually will</p> <p>mine that that that transaction that</p> <p>ultimately if lots and lots of people</p> <p>want to transact at the same time then</p> <p>there will be congestion so it's it's</p> <p>really just the case of randomly</p> <p>choosing transactions that come through</p> <p>I mean in principle priority here is</p> <p>that's precisely what priority is for</p> <p>times of congestion the runtime can</p> <p>basically state which transactions</p> <p>should be favored above which others but</p> <p>if if priority isn't enough or for</p> <p>whatever reason maybe everyone's got the</p> <p>same gas price I don't know whatever or</p> <p>you don't introduce any particularly</p> <p>compelling priority prioritization</p> <p>mechanism then random is is the best we</p> <p>can do</p> <p>cool Oh what was the what was the thing</p> <p>after transaction</p> <p>I've forgotten no is there something</p> <p>else to discuss yep okay anything before</p> <p>smart contracts yeah ah yeah okay yeah I</p> <p>can go into that so so the runtime</p> <p>encodes a lot a lot about what what the</p> <p>blockchain does how it works</p> <p>it doesn't encode everything in the</p> <p>substrate model because we don't want</p> <p>some things to be to be special what we</p> <p>could do is literally just put a rest</p> <p>executable on the chain and when that</p> <p>changes you have to kind of download the</p> <p>new one and run it but we don't like</p> <p>that there are I think I may well need</p> <p>to be corrected here but I think there</p> <p>are there is a certain other project</p> <p>that's trying to do governance and</p> <p>upgrade ability and that's more or less</p> <p>the model that it takes so it sort of</p> <p>basically puts its executable on the</p> <p>chain and it's up to the nodes to kind</p> <p>of download the new executable and run</p> <p>that I don't like that model I prefer to</p> <p>be a little bit more conservative about</p> <p>the specific component that can be</p> <p>upgraded and when we accept that part of</p> <p>the logic doesn't sit on chain for</p> <p>example the peer-to-peer networking</p> <p>library I don't think it's sensible to</p> <p>put that logic on the chain and there's</p> <p>even questions about putting consensus</p> <p>logic on the chain it could be that if</p> <p>consensus logic is on the chain then you</p> <p>have this kind of monoculture almost</p> <p>monocultural strategy for the consensus</p> <p>and that may lead to</p> <p>attack vectors by virtue of knowing that</p> <p>all of the nodes use the same strategy</p> <p>so if we're happy with not putting all</p> <p>of our logic onto the chain then the</p> <p>question is given that we need to have</p> <p>the same data structures ostensibly on</p> <p>the chain like in the runtime that's</p> <p>upgradeable and off the chain in the</p> <p>sort of general node itself how do we</p> <p>how do we manage the fact that sometimes</p> <p>those structures will be those data</p> <p>structures like transactions for example</p> <p>could be changed over the course of a</p> <p>chains life how do we how do we like</p> <p>manage the fact that these transactions</p> <p>have to then be sent they have to be</p> <p>stored in a transaction queue and they</p> <p>have to be sent over the network there</p> <p>have there has to be some way of</p> <p>handling these things right so we need</p> <p>some sort of object and that's where</p> <p>these opaque objects come in we need to</p> <p>a block needs to have some</p> <p>characteristics and there has to be some</p> <p>object that we can call a block but we</p> <p>don't need to go into the specific</p> <p>meaning of a block beyond basic the</p> <p>basic semantics of here's how to read a</p> <p>block number here's how to read the</p> <p>parent hash and these these very basic</p> <p>types or what we call the opaque types</p> <p>and they are the fundamental types of a</p> <p>block chain that don't change from</p> <p>Genesis onwards the in principle they're</p> <p>basically fixed now you say oh well hold</p> <p>on the extrinsic format is fixed and the</p> <p>block format is fixed and you know then</p> <p>surely you can't upgrade and it's like</p> <p>well actually it that's the reason that</p> <p>they are opaque is because most of the</p> <p>data that they contain is not stored in</p> <p>terms of specific fields like the the</p> <p>real meaning</p> <p>but rather it's just a blob a generic</p> <p>blob and it's only the bits of the data</p> <p>that we actually need to know for</p> <p>example we need to know the length of</p> <p>the transaction yep the extrinsic we you</p> <p>know because if we're going to send it</p> <p>around we need to how long it is and so</p> <p>what we do is we if we're going to</p> <p>concatenate it together into a block</p> <p>then we need to know how long each</p> <p>particular piece of the concatenation is</p> <p>so we we say write the one bit of a</p> <p>transaction of an extrinsic transactions</p> <p>format is going to be the length at the</p> <p>prefixed length but everything beyond</p> <p>that we're going to leave undefined as</p> <p>to its meaning we're just going to tell</p> <p>you how to decode and encode it you</p> <p>decode it by reading the length and then</p> <p>reading that many other bytes I'm not</p> <p>going to tell you what those bytes mean</p> <p>but that's how you decoded it and you</p> <p>encode it by seeing how long it is and</p> <p>then putting the length at the beginning</p> <p>and then following up with the other</p> <p>things by avoiding defining this stuff</p> <p>we can then define it in the runtime and</p> <p>then as runtimes upgrade we're not left</p> <p>with incompatible data structures that</p> <p>for handling these things in the client</p> <p>now it's important that so this isn't</p> <p>something that we do with every type</p> <p>it's just the fundamental cut types that</p> <p>clients do tend to have to be able to</p> <p>handle basically because we need to pass</p> <p>these types around the network or</p> <p>because we have to interpret them for</p> <p>the consensus algorithm so block headers</p> <p>one type extrinsic</p> <p>one of the type and I think hashes may</p> <p>be although hashes are paint data anyway</p> <p>I think it's basically just those two</p> <p>types yeah yeah although again</p> <p>signatures are opaque data anyway</p> <p>specific so you've got two types of</p> <p>signatures that float around in</p> <p>substrate you have to consent there are</p> <p>signatures on the consensus side and</p> <p>signatures on the signed on the</p> <p>transaction side so signatures on the</p> <p>transaction side they don't need to be</p> <p>the same and the runtime entirely</p> <p>interprets those I can well imagine</p> <p>extra</p> <p>substrate chains that don't have any</p> <p>signing any cryptographic signing on</p> <p>them at all that they're they're just</p> <p>you know the validators choose which</p> <p>things come along they you know from</p> <p>maybe some trusted corporate centralized</p> <p>database and they're just funneling this</p> <p>data in and it's going into the chain</p> <p>and just being recorded and maybe</p> <p>there's some state transitions that</p> <p>happen on the chain but basically it's</p> <p>that that's there's no need for</p> <p>signatures the consensus side yes there</p> <p>are signatures but I guess the consensus</p> <p>algorithm to define their own</p> <p>cryptography anyway I mentioned what</p> <p>sorry yeah so I I kind of spent a while</p> <p>describing that but I mean I can I guess</p> <p>I can probably if I can launch a node do</p> <p>I have one already oh yeah sure</p> <p>okay so yeah I have a node running okay</p> <p>so this is I think the demo node I'm</p> <p>gonna upgrade it okay so</p> <p>yeah okay so is that too small I guess</p> <p>that's way too small right how do i is</p> <p>that still too small it's too big okay</p> <p>so this is template node V - which I</p> <p>think means the demo is in but I can I</p> <p>can check this by so I mentioned there</p> <p>was the run time object fun time okay so</p> <p>the run time has a bunch of these are</p> <p>the various modules in the run time</p> <p>right so balances consensus core demo</p> <p>that's the one I just coded earlier</p> <p>today system timestamp upgrade key and</p> <p>version these as I mentioned come from</p> <p>the metadata so I can I can show you the</p> <p>code I mean it's it's I don't know how</p> <p>interesting is if we go into the</p> <p>double-oh-seven</p> <p>if we go into the double-oh-seven</p> <p>library and then the double-oh-seven</p> <p>substrate and then the bonds this is</p> <p>where they get created let me see if I</p> <p>can make this a bit bigger okay</p> <p>can you read that just about</p> <p>yeah I need a I need the drum player</p> <p>okay so these are these are the sort of</p> <p>easy ones that just they're just sort of</p> <p>hard-coded height header head fash name</p> <p>version and chain I mean you saw the RPC</p> <p>end of these we have this node service</p> <p>that just ensures there's a single</p> <p>WebSockets connection to the node so</p> <p>it's like a singleton and then we can I</p> <p>assure a request and these these are</p> <p>these are single shot requests some of</p> <p>these like head there subscriptions so</p> <p>there they use the pub sub functionality</p> <p>we have runtime version so I can eat I</p> <p>can I can give you a lighter quick and</p> <p>runtime I think it was in the core and</p> <p>then console log and that's what comes</p> <p>back very simple got the api's this this</p> <p>exactly represents this structure in</p> <p>rust that is in runtime template yeah so</p> <p>this this represents exactly this</p> <p>structure if I change this structure and</p> <p>upgrade the upgrade the chain then this</p> <p>will automatically update if I run this</p> <p>this thing again it will it will give me</p> <p>the new values yeah and it's the meta</p> <p>it's actually it's not the metadata that</p> <p>encodes that I think but that is that is</p> <p>fetched in this from the runtime in the</p> <p>same way that the metadata is fetched so</p> <p>the meta metadata is built automatically</p> <p>per module in the runtime amalgamated</p> <p>together by virtue of a couple of macros</p> <p>and then pass the line into the</p> <p>JavaScript and in the JavaScript we have</p> <p>a so we actually have a serialization</p> <p>library very very lightweight basically</p> <p>just memory representation serialization</p> <p>library and we have the opposite in</p> <p>JavaScript so we can serialize and</p> <p>deserialize in rest and we have the same</p> <p>thing in JavaScript and we can kind of a</p> <p>bit like a bit like JSON or whatever</p> <p>except binary and sort of designed to be</p> <p>very fast and very minimal lightweight</p> <p>yeah that's yeah the you mean these</p> <p>modules yeah so these are indeed there</p> <p>is a web pack running somewhere yeah</p> <p>yeah</p> <p>so got like MPM sitting around in the</p> <p>background updating are checking for</p> <p>changes and packing it all together ok</p> <p>so there's there's two things going on</p> <p>so the first is the these module these</p> <p>UI components those you have to code</p> <p>independently so they don't come from</p> <p>rust they're not automatically made you</p> <p>actually if you want to add a new a new</p> <p>module you have to sort of get get yeah</p> <p>typing fingers out and and and go into</p> <p>wherever it was that I went into now</p> <p>here we go yeah where is it now here so</p> <p>this is the yeah this is the UI and this</p> <p>isn't special at all this is just</p> <p>standard reacts semantic UI with web</p> <p>pack and NPM packing things in there</p> <p>looking out and watching it and packing</p> <p>it in the background so there's nothing</p> <p>I don't I don't so if I if I add any</p> <p>module then I have to press controller</p> <p>yeah but what happens I didn't press</p> <p>control I just now to get sorry if I do</p> <p>a blockchain upgrade I don't I don't</p> <p>have to press ctrl R now because the</p> <p>metadata automatically gets updated in</p> <p>the background so that doesn't come from</p> <p>the thing I was mentioning earlier with</p> <p>the hard-coded things so the bonds these</p> <p>bonds here the version bond and the the</p> <p>name chain the hi header hash these are</p> <p>all hard-coded they don't change their</p> <p>fundamental are PCs that substrate</p> <p>provides but the other things the things</p> <p>like if I go to run time and like I</p> <p>don't know balances if I want to get the</p> <p>balance of an account or accounts do I</p> <p>have let's decode an account let's</p> <p>decode this account so I want to get the</p> <p>balance of this guy then I can decode</p> <p>that into an account ID and give it to</p> <p>balance and then print the output and</p> <p>it's going to tell me that this guy</p> <p>doesn't have any money I think yeah</p> <p>balanced zero and then if I if I gave</p> <p>this guy some money so let's send some</p> <p>funds to him or her it's a hex address</p> <p>I'm not sure if they have gender do I</p> <p>have any Alice has got some I guess</p> <p>Alice is a girl and I'm going to send I</p> <p>don't know if I send a thousand units</p> <p>that's going through sent and then if I</p> <p>go back to balance is then we go now</p> <p>it's got a thousand yeah so this stuff</p> <p>when we go into specific run time</p> <p>modules they're not built they're not</p> <p>they don't come in by virtue of this</p> <p>code this code builds them</p> <p>programmatically from the metadata</p> <p>is has a pub/sub relationship with the</p> <p>with the node itself so as the nodes</p> <p>runtime gets upgraded this finds out</p> <p>about the upgrade grabs the metadata and</p> <p>rebuilds all of those objects and data</p> <p>structures and letters now interact with</p> <p>with the new runtime in a organic</p> <p>fashion but if we want to add UI</p> <p>components then we have to go in and do</p> <p>them ourselves and press controller the</p> <p>real a chain what what does it use</p> <p>so polka-dot uses power to codec</p> <p>polka-dot uses basically all of</p> <p>substrate like there's not much in</p> <p>substrate smart contracts is the only</p> <p>thing it doesn't use and yeah other than</p> <p>that it looks pretty similar to our</p> <p>basic substrate node so it's got all of</p> <p>the sort of functionality in apart from</p> <p>a smart contract but it does have an</p> <p>extra module that's specific to polka</p> <p>dot called</p> <p>para chains module so I haven't I'm not</p> <p>like it's been a little while since I</p> <p>looked at the para Chains module but</p> <p>that's something that will become pretty</p> <p>important</p> <p>over the next POC so PRC 3 was dedicated</p> <p>mainly to our new consensus algorithm</p> <p>that would be the final our algorithm</p> <p>for polka dot shaft</p> <p>or grandpa I don't know you know I mean</p> <p>I do know obviously shaft but some</p> <p>people don't not everyone agrees yeah</p> <p>sure so shaft is a actually is al here</p> <p>so al al invented shaft at the time it</p> <p>was called afge Al's finality gadget but</p> <p>we're kind of renaming it and basically</p> <p>it's a progressive adaptive progressive</p> <p>finality consensus algorithm designed</p> <p>specifically for polkadots use case and</p> <p>the idea is that it's a it adapts to</p> <p>network situations and validator</p> <p>pluralities if you have lots of</p> <p>validators sorry if you have few</p> <p>validators and a really good network</p> <p>then shaft will finalize as quickly as</p> <p>instant an instant finality algorithm</p> <p>like tender mint or rhododendron which</p> <p>is our sort of take on pbft for the</p> <p>blockchain but even if you have slower</p> <p>Network and lots of validators it will</p> <p>finalize as fast as it can behind the</p> <p>scenes and the way it does that is by</p> <p>having a transitive relationship over</p> <p>the blocks so the way that pbft derived</p> <p>algorithms work in general is you have a</p> <p>candidate block so every every block</p> <p>number that you want to finalize every</p> <p>block that you want to finalize there is</p> <p>a candidate right it's not yet finalized</p> <p>so it's just one of many and then you</p> <p>put it to a bunch of vault authorities</p> <p>or validators that the participants in</p> <p>this consensus game and they will each</p> <p>if it's a pbft based thing they'll do a</p> <p>a pre commit</p> <p>to basically say this is the one that we</p> <p>think should win and then if they see</p> <p>enough other pre-commit they'll they'll</p> <p>move on to a commit and there were rules</p> <p>about how you whether you can change</p> <p>from a pre given that you've pre</p> <p>committed on one thing whether you can</p> <p>change your you know what what you're</p> <p>allowed to commit to and if you've</p> <p>committed on one thing whether you're</p> <p>allowed to switch that commitment and</p> <p>these rules basically guarantee that</p> <p>assuming no more than two thirds plus</p> <p>one Byzantine nodes or Byzantine</p> <p>participants in the game that you will</p> <p>always come to an agreement on what it</p> <p>is that on a particular candidate now</p> <p>this is fine it's a perfectly reasonable</p> <p>way to go but the problem is that block</p> <p>it's not optimal because block chains</p> <p>have relationships blocks have</p> <p>relationships between each of them so</p> <p>blocks that are all of the same number</p> <p>so they're all at the same level they're</p> <p>just can different candidates for the</p> <p>same potential slot don't have much of a</p> <p>relationship beyond being mutually</p> <p>exclusive but blocks that appear before</p> <p>so parents or ancestor blocks have a</p> <p>very very strong relationship right</p> <p>cryptographic relationship we store</p> <p>their hash which means as an implication</p> <p>that if you voted for block I don't know</p> <p>that that 68 references by virtue of its</p> <p>parent hash you're you've also voted for</p> <p>that right you've also voted for 66 or</p> <p>Genesis block assuming that the network</p> <p>conditions are such that you are not</p> <p>going to be able to afford to finalize</p> <p>every block then a vote for 68 should</p> <p>definitely imply a vote for 64 67 and so</p> <p>forth but for that 67 yep so if there's</p> <p>two folks if there's a fork and what</p> <p>it's made its way to block deep</p> <p>okay maybe asn't made yeah actually you</p> <p>could have in principle have made it's</p> <p>way too much deep just at the production</p> <p>stage then it's important that any vote</p> <p>not allowed to do under this transitive</p> <p>model is both commit to 68 on one fork</p> <p>and to the 67 on the other fork and that</p> <p>that's one of the things that now</p> <p>becomes illegal but because that's</p> <p>illegal it what it means is that we can</p> <p>interpret a vote for 68 as a vote for</p> <p>all of the blocks that haven't yet been</p> <p>finalized on that on that fork and if</p> <p>suppose we suppose where that last the</p> <p>most recently finalized block is</p> <p>terrible network conditions the most</p> <p>recent recent finalized block is like</p> <p>say block 50 yeah so we're running 18</p> <p>blocks in advance of the of the most</p> <p>recent sort of had agreed on head of the</p> <p>chain then if we've seen let's suppose</p> <p>we have 10 validators and they're</p> <p>basically just validate they're just</p> <p>voting for the blocks that they see we</p> <p>can only get out one vote per block and</p> <p>it's our vote so actually that's not</p> <p>I've got 20 validators and we can only</p> <p>get out one vote per block what would</p> <p>happen is that under Undershaft these</p> <p>votes we would always be running at the</p> <p>actually no because we only need \u2154 so</p> <p>it'd be the 13<sup>th</sup> or 14<sup>th</sup> most recent</p> <p>vote vote because we can accept all of</p> <p>the votes that are that are were on</p> <p>blocks after let's say where were 50 so</p> <p>suppose we're trying to finalize like I</p> <p>don't know 53 yeah all of the votes on</p> <p>that fork after 53 so every validator is</p> <p>like doing one vote per block so one of</p> <p>them is voted on 54 one of them is voted</p> <p>on 55 one</p> <p>voted on 56 all the way up to 67 or 68</p> <p>where every were then it's likely that</p> <p>every new block \u2154 plus 1 will have</p> <p>voted on one more than the last block in</p> <p>total access account ensures</p> <p>every new block that's being produced</p> <p>that validator will be voting on that</p> <p>new block which will imply they voted on</p> <p>all of the blocks up until that new</p> <p>block which will imply you've got one</p> <p>more vote assuming a constant cycling of</p> <p>validators one more vote on that chain</p> <p>in general and so because that chains</p> <p>been brought forward by a block because</p> <p>everyone's voting on that chain then the</p> <p>the the the most recent block to be</p> <p>finalized will probably be a bit further</p> <p>along as a network conditions improve we</p> <p>can get invalidated can get more</p> <p>messages out then that will catch up</p> <p>naturally because the greater number of</p> <p>votes will be recent and and therefore</p> <p>again transitive relationships being</p> <p>what they are you'll be able to</p> <p>basically form a consensus that two</p> <p>thirds plus one validators agree that in</p> <p>fact 62 is the most recent shared block</p> <p>that they can all finalize it's a pain</p> <p>to spot when a validator has behaved</p> <p>badly basically because the rules are</p> <p>transitive sorry yeah rules are</p> <p>transitive and so you have to enter into</p> <p>this in the worst case enter into this</p> <p>game of querying well hold on you you as</p> <p>a validator voted for this block on this</p> <p>chain but yet you voted for that block</p> <p>on that chain why what were you seeing</p> <p>what what signatures did you see that</p> <p>made you switch chains and they can</p> <p>either equivocate and say move don't</p> <p>know because they actually they switch</p> <p>chains in</p> <p>invalidly or they can provide you with</p> <p>the signatures in which case you have to</p> <p>go to the next guy along and say well</p> <p>you signed for this chain but you you</p> <p>know and the game continues basically</p> <p>it's quite a an unwieldy game and it's a</p> <p>it's a bit of a pain it's a bit tedious</p> <p>to play but it's it's something that can</p> <p>happen on chain and it's not the end of</p> <p>the world beyond that it's it's got some</p> <p>very nice proofs about how live it stays</p> <p>in an asynchronous environment and its</p> <p>optimal over the it uses the notion of</p> <p>block transitivity optimally in</p> <p>determining under a pbft style mechanism</p> <p>which is the most recent lock that it</p> <p>can be considered final okay</p> <p>under optimal Network conditions</p> <p>assuming the validators are well</p> <p>connected with each other and that their</p> <p>plurality because I mean it's pbft so</p> <p>you can't get around this N squared</p> <p>message passing stuff requirements but</p> <p>assuming that they're well connected and</p> <p>and there aren't too many of them then</p> <p>you know I don't I mean you know this is</p> <p>where empirical measurements come in but</p> <p>certainly with our test net so far</p> <p>there's no reason to think that we can't</p> <p>handle</p> <p>final final is finalizing most blocks so</p> <p>not staying very far behind the block</p> <p>production head at all so the block</p> <p>production is handled by a separate</p> <p>consensus mechanism that doesn't provide</p> <p>finality at the moment we're moving</p> <p>towards or and which is a randomized</p> <p>shuffled version of hora which basically</p> <p>just sounds for Authority round and you</p> <p>just go around a bunch of round-robin</p> <p>style block production game but it's our</p> <p>intention eventually to move to probably</p> <p>something similar to a ruborous which is</p> <p>a it's basically like proof of authority</p> <p>mapped on a proof-of-work mapped onto a</p> <p>proof of authority schema so all thority</p> <p>get given lucky slots whereby they can</p> <p>mine a block and and it's a way of</p> <p>generating generating these lucky slots</p> <p>and and I'm ministering them in such a</p> <p>way that that you get given a bunch of</p> <p>guarantees about Byzantine tolerance</p> <p>so Network network topology or</p> <p>peer-to-peer networking in general we're</p> <p>using lib p2p which is pretty modular I</p> <p>would in principle there's nothing that</p> <p>would stop you from writing a new module</p> <p>that would provide the sort of</p> <p>networking that yeah I mean if you want</p> <p>something like Onion Routing on like</p> <p>mixed nuts yeah I don't see why that</p> <p>wouldn't be possible using the existing</p> <p>network module system worst case it's</p> <p>probably like implementing it as a as a</p> <p>new API but that's something we'd look</p> <p>into now I think I think it's what you</p> <p>can can build on top of it I mean we'd</p> <p>certainly be interested to sort of</p> <p>explore if the API is a sufficient in</p> <p>order to provide that but I suspect they</p> <p>might be okay more questions when how</p> <p>long it was at 8 p.m. do we want to</p> <p>maybe you think yeah yeah I it will be a</p> <p>little bit harsh but yeah I think ok</p> <p>let's let's erm maybe move the questions</p> <p>towards the end and do a I don't know</p> <p>some exciting stuff do you want to plug</p> <p>in the HDMI oh yeah I'm glad that you're</p> <p>doing this cuz I need to go to toilet</p> <p>yeah yeah sure thing use do we do we</p> <p>have working toilets yeah yeah</p> <p>outside so gay oh cool</p> <p>so let's get started this demo is like</p> <p>well it wasn't prepared at all because</p> <p>of his ins and I and I had to improvise</p> <p>so yeah um yeah let's get started so</p> <p>because I basically don't have any UI</p> <p>because of as I mentioned reasons I have</p> <p>to do like I have to craft in extrinsic</p> <p>by hand</p> <p>basically yeah but I have some little</p> <p>code snippets that actually can help me</p> <p>with that so it's not that problematic</p> <p>is it okay yeah</p> <p>okay so let's start this let's start</p> <p>with a fresh chain for that that make</p> <p>that maybe might take some time</p> <p>yep yep it's basically the branch a</p> <p>second I know I would say now because</p> <p>yeah for some reason I chose to use the</p> <p>soft shoe type oh yeah so let's clear</p> <p>the DB and then let's launch this new</p> <p>chain yeah so it seems to be working and</p> <p>yeah so so to make an extrinsic we need</p> <p>some to do some boilerplate code and for</p> <p>that we need a genetics hash so like it</p> <p>it is required to create extreme six</p> <p>that that can be executed on this</p> <p>particular change so we need to first</p> <p>fetch the block hash of the Ganesha's</p> <p>and for that I will I'm going to use</p> <p>the RPC cash so I will call block hash</p> <p>function this argument zero which which</p> <p>is for Genesis block and so oh yeah</p> <p>actually it's already there yeah and</p> <p>after that I will regenerate all extreme</p> <p>six so yeah so this extrinsic this big</p> <p>blob of up our data is contains</p> <p>instructions to deploy a certain</p> <p>contract and the the most of this data</p> <p>actually represents webassembly smart</p> <p>contract and yeah let's let's actually</p> <p>submit that extrinsic up have this one</p> <p>but it doesn't yeah oh yeah</p> <p>yep so to verify that it actually</p> <p>executed well let's see the substrate UI</p> <p>oh do you have an idea how to look up or</p> <p>a nonce of Ellis yeah yeah yeah</p> <p>as I said network I can connect to you</p> <p>ah yeah it's def okay yeah in JavaScript</p> <p>oh sorry sorry guys I can't stop I come</p> <p>on okay so the runtime and then balances</p> <p>is where the hold on it's not system by</p> <p>the index is stored and then I can't</p> <p>nonce and then which I can't ah</p> <p>Ellis Oh Alice and we should get Alice's</p> <p>so we need to introduce a the seed for</p> <p>Alice which is a pain to do if you don't</p> <p>do you have some key I yep and try to</p> <p>just execute it in here yeah</p> <p>it's okay yeah it just works</p> <p>oh but is it the latest version of</p> <p>something it's from air each hour but</p> <p>I'm not sure yes later</p> <p>yeah does work cool totally I expect</p> <p>okay</p> <p>oh how can I help you I want to get</p> <p>these Safari oh okay</p> <p>right so we put that scene in there you</p> <p>put it yeah so while this has this yeah</p> <p>now this is a short oh yeah this is</p> <p>something that should go over actually</p> <p>because this is kind of cool but I'll do</p> <p>it afterwards so we can try that</p> <p>everyone can see what's happened there</p> <p>right okay</p> <p>Oh doesn't suffice all that well</p> <p>I wouldn't be surprised actually okay</p> <p>[Music]</p> <p>maybe it's not about ten part I mean</p> <p>maybe yeah nons account okay</p> <p>maybe should open fire</p> <p>let's just check decode and then Alice's</p> <p>ID okay so that's done something that</p> <p>wasn't a type error but it's so that</p> <p>means that our transaction actually got</p> <p>in and we deployed the test contract so</p> <p>now I'm gonna show what kind of contract</p> <p>this is yeah so so this contract is</p> <p>basic counter which has actually two</p> <p>functions to action that we can actually</p> <p>execute on it let me do ya so the first</p> <p>one is in command that takes you 32</p> <p>parameter which specifies by the value</p> <p>by which we should document this counter</p> <p>and get function which basically returns</p> <p>the value and when the contract is</p> <p>executed we just read input data it's</p> <p>basically the same as in Hulme and</p> <p>decode it into this action</p> <p>in a very enumeration and then depending</p> <p>on what actual variant of this you know</p> <p>we performing the action and this in</p> <p>case of increment we just query the</p> <p>contract storage by certain key which is</p> <p>the specified value and then save it</p> <p>back into the storage encoding it and</p> <p>before that and get is basically just we</p> <p>read the storage and return that value</p> <p>and that's it yeah</p> <p>so this contract is already on on the</p> <p>this chain and yeah so there is a</p> <p>extrinsic that which with which we can</p> <p>call this specific contract and it takes</p> <p>address of that contract and address is</p> <p>calculated by the constructor code of</p> <p>this contract and the original address</p> <p>which sent this which sent the create</p> <p>extrinsic and this so again yeah</p> <p>actually it's used and so it's specified</p> <p>right here so for the first transaction</p> <p>it was zero extrinsic and for the second</p> <p>one it's one yeah okay I see what you</p> <p>mean for determining contract address</p> <p>nonce is not used only code of</p> <p>constructor a region and just like</p> <p>input data and that's it yeah yeah</p> <p>basically yes but you can alleviate it</p> <p>with providing different data so we push</p> <p>this issue to user side yeah</p> <p>and yes so we doing call this to the</p> <p>contract at the specified address this</p> <p>we thinking some funds to it and also</p> <p>specifying how much gas we want to</p> <p>allocate to that and also we're</p> <p>providing the input data for the</p> <p>contract and this data is actually just</p> <p>encoding the index of the action so in</p> <p>in our case it's 0 so it corresponds to</p> <p>this variant and these four bytes</p> <p>encodes basically number by which we</p> <p>increment yeah</p> <p>and let's let's execute this yeah for</p> <p>now it's the only way but like we</p> <p>basically don't have either cell right</p> <p>now and it's the thing that is</p> <p>developing right now yeah so yes</p> <p>and so these extreme six extrinsic is</p> <p>for calling this contract</p> <p>yep so I think it is executed and to</p> <p>verify that it's actually performing the</p> <p>the task let's just check the substrate</p> <p>storage for for this corresponding</p> <p>storage key of that contract and I have</p> <p>because it's kind of hard to my to know</p> <p>which address is that I have a special</p> <p>function that actually calculates this</p> <p>for me and yeah and let's take it and</p> <p>[Music]</p> <p>it's really yeah so okay here's the</p> <p>result</p> <p>and it's corresponds to one in encoded</p> <p>in little endian format and this is a</p> <p>specific thing for encoding the length</p> <p>of this data so yeah it basically worked</p> <p>and then let's try to increment it once</p> <p>again by I don't know</p> <p>yeah wait a second I don't understand</p> <p>that</p> <p>so this extrinsic is in memory pool and</p> <p>let's wait until it actually yep it's</p> <p>mind and then let's query the storage</p> <p>and yeah it looks like it's eight yeah</p> <p>sure yeah that's a good question let me</p> <p>show you know so basically it's more</p> <p>more like a few Mike environment and so</p> <p>for now we basically have bare minimum</p> <p>for writing contracts and it's I get</p> <p>said storage and then call create which</p> <p>basically is very similar to thin ones</p> <p>return checking input size and also like</p> <p>this it also have has a scratch buffer</p> <p>and it's something that is not in Hulme</p> <p>so because of yeah I didn't mention that</p> <p>that storage in</p> <p>substrate contracts have like arbitrary</p> <p>size at values so you can put not only</p> <p>you query it you you can basically</p> <p>return it in this user specified area</p> <p>I mean contracts it's fight area of</p> <p>memory but then like it's like if the</p> <p>contract doesn't track track the size of</p> <p>the values that it actually puts in in</p> <p>this in storage then it could easily</p> <p>overwrite the like memory of the</p> <p>contract and this can be a bad thing so</p> <p>because of this we all arbitrary size</p> <p>that values are put into scratch buffer</p> <p>and then contract can actually query</p> <p>this buffer to actually load data from</p> <p>it yeah so it depends actually so you</p> <p>can't use I know anything that depends</p> <p>on files trading and things like that</p> <p>but like everything that doesn't require</p> <p>my saturating system things like files</p> <p>and things like that and can be compile</p> <p>it to the assembly and then probably</p> <p>fine</p> <p>yeah so basically this system is very</p> <p>similar to a theme and we basically have</p> <p>like a smattering very similar to a</p> <p>theme I mean like every year Vice</p> <p>Minister action is metrid and like I</p> <p>mean every instruction in the block just</p> <p>Metford as the price of the dairy prices</p> <p>are similar up and just deducted from</p> <p>some counter and if it goes to the zero</p> <p>then there's out of gas succession yeah</p> <p>so we are planning on bringing in</p> <p>chromatic gas yeah yeah and also they</p> <p>think I wanted to mention that we about</p> <p>the API that we are also thinking about</p> <p>giving the contractor on time</p> <p>chance to call different modules outside</p> <p>of I mean inside the run time so it can</p> <p>actually call do Kevin and well yeah so</p> <p>means governance modules even the power</p> <p>chain module that would forward any</p> <p>potentially could could have open an</p> <p>entry point a function call to forward</p> <p>messages into a para train so we can</p> <p>imagine is a smart contract sitting on</p> <p>one pair of chain sending out messages</p> <p>to a smart contract on another pair of</p> <p>chain or sending messages into a</p> <p>governance system so a smart contract</p> <p>chain like the edgeware chain that was</p> <p>mentioned today could have smart</p> <p>contracts that you know manage people's</p> <p>voting preferences yeah that's something</p> <p>I mean yeah for the gas it differs a</p> <p>little from aetherium one of the things</p> <p>that I wanted to bring into a theorem</p> <p>like when it was too late to bring it in</p> <p>was this notion of chromatic gas which</p> <p>is basically having three different</p> <p>kinds of gas one of them for processing</p> <p>one of them for memory usage and one for</p> <p>storage with the idea being that</p> <p>basically we can compute maximum gas per</p> <p>block in terms of resource usage for</p> <p>each of these three but doesn't make</p> <p>sense that if someone gives up some</p> <p>processing power that they can instead</p> <p>bloat the chain by some storage right</p> <p>then the two are not the two are not</p> <p>somehow mutually exclusive so what we do</p> <p>is we actually have the resource usage</p> <p>independently for each three and then</p> <p>every contract gets basically whenever</p> <p>you spend one gas on processing you sort</p> <p>of get one gas on the other two for free</p> <p>or vice versa</p> <p>the gas sort of comes in in in white</p> <p>light where you get all of the</p> <p>independent gases sort of tied together</p> <p>and then you can use them as you as you</p> <p>want and what you don't use either irem</p> <p>really decided but it either gets sort</p> <p>of ignored or goes back into the pot so</p> <p>that other things can in principle</p> <p>overspend but what this does it</p> <p>basically means you've got much better</p> <p>resource usage utilization and you don't</p> <p>have the issue whereby you can bloat the</p> <p>chain by 3x what you should be able to</p> <p>just by using all of your gas to enter</p> <p>into storage and none of your gas or</p> <p>memory or processing which is what the</p> <p>sort of scenario we're stuck with</p> <p>aetherium oh why not GPU as well well</p> <p>maybe version 2</p> <p>yeah we'll go into the contracts right</p> <p>so yeah this so for like the gas system</p> <p>is only a concern of contract model and</p> <p>any other modules doesn't know about it</p> <p>at all yeah I think so</p> <p>then cool so I'll mention one other</p> <p>thing which is the account indexing</p> <p>which is what we saw earlier do you want</p> <p>to know I can do it on yours I think I</p> <p>mean yes but it's it's a nice little</p> <p>thing so it's worth it's worth knowing</p> <p>it well can you how do I get to Safari</p> <p>okay so if you noticed before while I</p> <p>was mucking around down here can I make</p> <p>this bigger somehow you can do this</p> <p>little trick oh just so there is a if</p> <p>you hold ctrl you can scroll it like</p> <p>that yeah so if you notice up up here</p> <p>Alice has a so I we've got two accounts</p> <p>here default and Alice default is this</p> <p>big long big long address analysis this</p> <p>lovely little address right so this is a</p> <p>legit these are both legit addresses and</p> <p>if you you know in principle if if a</p> <p>substrate chain gets listed on an</p> <p>exchange then in principle you can get</p> <p>one of these addresses this is just an</p> <p>address like in Bitcoin in etherium</p> <p>right but they both are so Alice this</p> <p>isn't some cunning name registry or</p> <p>something this is an address we</p> <p>understand yeah we're going with this</p> <p>[Music]</p> <p>in principle yeah it will mean different</p> <p>things on different chains because it</p> <p>will reference a different account just</p> <p>this just as the other one the long one</p> <p>would so the long one is a they're both</p> <p>based 58 representations they both got a</p> <p>checksum in them they both got a version</p> <p>byte in them the difference is that the</p> <p>first one is a 32 byte public key from</p> <p>that represents a point on the edy 255 1</p> <p>nine public key and the other one is an</p> <p>index and that's why it can be so short</p> <p>so every account in in a if you use the</p> <p>SRM L in substrate every account has a</p> <p>an index associated with it I should say</p> <p>every nonzero balance account writes</p> <p>every account that's active has an index</p> <p>associated with it if an account doesn't</p> <p>have doesn't have any balance then it</p> <p>doesn't get one of these nice short IDs</p> <p>because there's no index I so it can't</p> <p>like then you marry every account then</p> <p>you may as well just use the 32 byte</p> <p>identifier but if it's got something in</p> <p>it then you can use this use this index</p> <p>instead to identify it and we've got a</p> <p>mechanism whereby if it's within the</p> <p>first 200 or so then you get to just use</p> <p>one byte and if it's in the next sixty</p> <p>or thousand then you get to use the next</p> <p>byte they're two bytes and I think</p> <p>there's only like tens of thousands of</p> <p>active accounts on of active accounts</p> <p>that have any real significant funds in</p> <p>on like aetherium so i don't i suspect</p> <p>on substrate chains we'll probably see</p> <p>most addresses to be fewer basically be</p> <p>like four six five or six characters and</p> <p>it basically can look that up in its</p> <p>enumeration of all addresses and and as</p> <p>these things become free so if an</p> <p>account goes to zero substrates SRM our</p> <p>balances module will automatically claim</p> <p>reclaim that that address right so it</p> <p>basically deletes everything to do with</p> <p>it</p> <p>and this including this enumeration and</p> <p>so if someone like has one of the</p> <p>earlier Guinea I can't imagine that</p> <p>there's gonna be something like clamor</p> <p>to get the first to enjoy the accounts</p> <p>that have you know these four four</p> <p>letter addresses cause like there's only</p> <p>so many of them and before long they'll</p> <p>go but if someone like reduces their</p> <p>balance disease or to the minimum below</p> <p>the minimum allowed balance there's this</p> <p>notion of an existential deposit which</p> <p>is basically the minimum amount of</p> <p>balance you must have for your account</p> <p>not just to be deleted dying like that</p> <p>if they're iam Bitcoin don't really have</p> <p>this which leads to an awful lot of dust</p> <p>accounts that have like a none spend</p> <p>ibly small amount of of ether in it so</p> <p>small that you know you can't actually</p> <p>send the transaction to but yet they're</p> <p>still recorded by the state so they're</p> <p>still taking up a lot of space on disk</p> <p>exchanges are particularly bad for these</p> <p>things but you know they they leave a</p> <p>bit of gas on the spent and that just</p> <p>that's just a tiny little bit of ether</p> <p>just clogging up the train chain to the</p> <p>like 10,000 accounts a day sort of job</p> <p>so this is why in principle yes so if</p> <p>this account becomes a discount like</p> <p>reduces below the existential deposit</p> <p>and then someone else claims it then</p> <p>that address won't last forever so</p> <p>there's couple of ways of dealing with</p> <p>that the first is that that address has</p> <p>in it a checksum and that checksum</p> <p>refers to not that address itself but to</p> <p>the account that that address points to</p> <p>so if they were to if they were to do it</p> <p>maliciously it wouldn't happen</p> <p>accidentally the checksum would look</p> <p>after that they were to do it</p> <p>maliciously they'd have to mine an</p> <p>address that whose checksum was the same</p> <p>and these accounts these small ones you</p> <p>can choose which address you want to use</p> <p>yes sorry you can choose which address</p> <p>format you want to use and some of the</p> <p>address formats have like eight byte</p> <p>checksums so they'd have to mine an</p> <p>address that had like eight whole byte</p> <p>that shared an eight byte</p> <p>start of a hash with with the address</p> <p>that sort with the address that's IO</p> <p>that's that so I mean I can see this not</p> <p>being so so much of an issue and to be</p> <p>honest if you want if you want an</p> <p>address that's like you know permanent</p> <p>then sure just use the big big long one</p> <p>yeah</p> <p>but if if you want something that's like</p> <p>a payment address or if you absolutely</p> <p>sure that you're never going to go below</p> <p>the minimum amount then as these small</p> <p>addresses should be fine and they're a</p> <p>lot easier to remember and the other</p> <p>notable other point is that if we delete</p> <p>accounts and this came up in aetherium</p> <p>so parity we apparently made a proposal</p> <p>on the IPS to sort of say look we should</p> <p>have disk election that was actually</p> <p>implemented on covin right we rolled it</p> <p>out to covin and the issue one of the</p> <p>issues is that it means that nan</p> <p>basically transactions can be replayed</p> <p>if you're not careful because when you</p> <p>delete an address you don't just delete</p> <p>the balance and reduce that zero but you</p> <p>also delete the nonce which is counting</p> <p>how many transactions it's sent which</p> <p>means the first transactions can now be</p> <p>replayed or the very first transaction</p> <p>in particular can be replayed and then</p> <p>the second third and fourth can if that</p> <p>goes through successfully and that's</p> <p>problematic or it could be problematic</p> <p>because if those transactions do</p> <p>something other than spending the</p> <p>balance then you can actually put</p> <p>balance into the now zero account so</p> <p>it's now got cash to spend</p> <p>and then replay those transactions to do</p> <p>this to replay the side effects this is</p> <p>why we brought in the transaction errors</p> <p>so the idea is that when you construct a</p> <p>transaction it's only valid for a</p> <p>particular period for the future so you</p> <p>can make a trend you can construct a</p> <p>transaction that's valid indefinitely we</p> <p>allow for that but if you do that you've</p> <p>got to accept the fact that if someone</p> <p>else if your account gets deleted then</p> <p>the first transactions can be replayed</p> <p>primarily because there may be well</p> <p>firstly cause we you know we're</p> <p>generalists and we like to you know</p> <p>allow for as much as possible and it's</p> <p>up to our users who we we believe our</p> <p>our esteemed you know we esteem them in</p> <p>terms of their intelligence and we</p> <p>believe that they know what they're</p> <p>doing I mean you know everything goes</p> <p>wrong at some point I I don't believe in</p> <p>making tools you know I don't believe in</p> <p>making kind of safety scissors for you</p> <p>know for people I think that you know</p> <p>the level at least that were at you know</p> <p>we should we should be working with</p> <p>sharp knives for sure official and but I</p> <p>would put this on the user level so I</p> <p>think this is for you know if you read</p> <p>some of the other chains they issue kind</p> <p>of not warnings but directives to their</p> <p>middleware and use a user level like UI</p> <p>engineers say look this you can cut</p> <p>yourself the chain doesn't protect users</p> <p>from doing the stupid thing so it's up</p> <p>to you to protect them by putting in</p> <p>these warnings and we will do the same</p> <p>so for example if you're if you've</p> <p>issued if your wallet knows you've</p> <p>issued transaction resolve doesn't know</p> <p>that you haven't issued IRRI limited</p> <p>transactions and sees that a transaction</p> <p>you're about to issue would remove your</p> <p>account with the would delete it would</p> <p>take you below the minimum amount then</p> <p>it will would basically bring up this</p> <p>big what it would either not let you do</p> <p>it or bring up a big warning saying are</p> <p>you sure you know what you're doing yeah</p> <p>yeah so if you know we don't want to</p> <p>like hamstring people at developing on</p> <p>the platform we want to inform them and</p> <p>we want to inform them when they should</p> <p>hamstring the people who were using</p> <p>their what they're developing or at</p> <p>least give them information to make sure</p> <p>that they don't shoot themselves in the</p> <p>foot</p> <p>yeah it's true I mean there's maybe a</p> <p>trade-off to be made here checksum</p> <p>seemed a perfectly reasonable thing I</p> <p>mean most address formats have checked</p> <p>sums in the original aetherium didn't</p> <p>and that was a really big pain so that</p> <p>was that was just less and learnt in</p> <p>this case I don't think there has been a</p> <p>lesson yet to be learnt and I think it's</p> <p>such a really easy thing to protect</p> <p>against like either wallets shouldn't</p> <p>let you construct transactions without</p> <p>errors that should be a niche thing that</p> <p>you have to build your own applications</p> <p>to do I mean the cambia that I can</p> <p>imagine applications where errors don't</p> <p>fit for example suppose you've got</p> <p>something like a plasma plasma kind of</p> <p>chain and or a state a state channel and</p> <p>you need this transaction to potentially</p> <p>last indefinitely</p> <p>because that's the only guarantee that</p> <p>the other side has that you won't just</p> <p>pull out after the era is ended yeah</p> <p>it's like there's no other way of doing</p> <p>it and there you just have to ensure</p> <p>that for your specific niche use case</p> <p>there is no way of reducing that balance</p> <p>below the existential deposit but in</p> <p>most use cases user level tools can make</p> <p>sure that you don't shoot yourself in</p> <p>the foot say again</p> <p>oh when you see well it's a transaction</p> <p>hold on so when you serialize a</p> <p>transaction I see what you mean yes can</p> <p>we carry yes the answer is yes we can</p> <p>carry our concise address format into</p> <p>transactions as well so normally we</p> <p>would have to put a 32 by identifier for</p> <p>each address for the sender and the</p> <p>receiver irritatingly so one of the</p> <p>things that if you read about Edie two</p> <p>four five one nine they'll be like oh</p> <p>yeah it's really good it's got like</p> <p>compact signatures its signatures are</p> <p>smaller there are only 64 bytes instead</p> <p>of 65 what they don't tell you is that</p> <p>unlike unlike ECDSA you do need to put</p> <p>the sender address in there so yes you</p> <p>might you might shave a bite off in</p> <p>terms of the signature but you have to</p> <p>add an extra 32 bytes on because you</p> <p>have to tell it who the sender is</p> <p>I mean Bitcoin doesn't kind of Bitcoin</p> <p>provides both but you know whatever</p> <p>that was just a questionable decision if</p> <p>there him doesn't we go we don't bother</p> <p>encoding the sender in the transaction</p> <p>because we derive it directly from the</p> <p>signature you can't do that with EDD si</p> <p>sorry with Edie 2 5 1 9</p> <p>so actually signatures are 96 bytes</p> <p>we have a binary format so we don't have</p> <p>padding we have a binary format that</p> <p>basically uses 33 bytes to encode one</p> <p>other 32 byte addresses and uses one</p> <p>byte to encode the small ones and and so</p> <p>forth and you can determine what it is</p> <p>from the first few bits yeah so it did</p> <p>if you use these small addresses you</p> <p>shave off like 60 bytes potentially a</p> <p>couple more from the transactions and</p> <p>that's that's a pretty decent saving it</p> <p>basically cuts transactions by \u2156 as</p> <p>the relay train yeah I mean so the</p> <p>substrate comes from the relay chain so</p> <p>when we started coding polka dot well</p> <p>when we started coding substrate what</p> <p>has become substrate that was just</p> <p>called polka dot and although even</p> <p>before we started I had in my mind it</p> <p>was going to turn into substrate I</p> <p>didn't really mention that to the other</p> <p>devs so they were a little surprised</p> <p>when I started renaming stuff but yeah</p> <p>it's the biggest the biggest challenge</p> <p>is kind of thing that I mentioned it's</p> <p>getting that level of generalism while</p> <p>still making things be easy too</p> <p>while still making it easy to write the</p> <p>things that you want to be able to write</p> <p>so that that's what you know any design</p> <p>of language or API comes down to this</p> <p>getting this trade-off right and it</p> <p>ultimately comes down to expressivity</p> <p>so expressivity of a of a language in a</p> <p>domain is really just how well you can</p> <p>make it easy to do the things that you</p> <p>want to do and make it possible to do</p> <p>everything</p> <p>yeah and bringing those two closer</p> <p>together is is what we call expressivity</p> <p>or what we call a good language or a</p> <p>good a good domain language</p> <p>and you know substrate has a similar</p> <p>challenge getting it getting it general</p> <p>is not so easy</p> <p>it's something I've you know kind of</p> <p>wanted to do even since CPP aetherium</p> <p>but not having had all of the experience</p> <p>it wasn't so easy to do it the early</p> <p>days but it gets it gets a bit easier</p> <p>with having coded a couple more Sega is</p> <p>data deleted when it's deleted</p> <p>okay so what was the question again</p> <p>okay so specifically with smart</p> <p>contracts or with runtime modules and</p> <p>and the the substrate in general not</p> <p>really but smart contracts kind of have</p> <p>to do their own thing to some degree but</p> <p>okay I'll talk about substrate in</p> <p>general because that's what I can answer</p> <p>yes I see I know what you mean now I</p> <p>know what you mean yes no contracts work</p> <p>differently</p> <p>okay so we have we have archive mode</p> <p>that keeps everything around forever it</p> <p>doesn't run an archive mode by by you by</p> <p>by default it runs in a standard pruning</p> <p>mode by default which basically Clips</p> <p>any state from blocks that are old</p> <p>enough after a 100 or 200 or so if what</p> <p>you're talking about is like in a theory</p> <p>and when a contract delete something if</p> <p>that contract if that call into that</p> <p>contract turns out to be exceptional and</p> <p>everything gets rolled back then that</p> <p>delete doesn't happen in substrate in</p> <p>the basic runtime module in the basic</p> <p>sort of core we don't do roll backs</p> <p>right so as soon as something gets</p> <p>written into storage or deleted from</p> <p>storage it's actually deleted and unless</p> <p>the entire block gets rolled back</p> <p>because it panics then it's done that</p> <p>thing's deleted and there's no way you</p> <p>can you don't have checkpointing in</p> <p>there if you want checkpointing which</p> <p>you may well want it goes into the it</p> <p>goes into the as a runtime module</p> <p>library and the contract runtime module</p> <p>library that the smart contract actually</p> <p>implements checkpointing so it's it</p> <p>implements something that is basically a</p> <p>minimal form of aetherium but has most</p> <p>of the stuff of the etherium environment</p> <p>and the only difference is that it</p> <p>doesn't run in a VM it runs in</p> <p>webassembly</p> <p>of course web assemblies kind of cool</p> <p>and sexy unfashionable and hipster</p> <p>yeah I mean you know to some degree</p> <p>runtime upgrades and these sort of</p> <p>out-of-band</p> <p>state changes are are specifically what</p> <p>we do how we manage what happens when</p> <p>things go south in other ways so</p> <p>ultimately there's the same safeguard if</p> <p>you want to call it that that any other</p> <p>chain would have that doesn't have a</p> <p>governance system which is it can always</p> <p>be hard forked even if the governess</p> <p>system of the polka dot substrate</p> <p>whatever goes Ori I I sort of take a</p> <p>two-prong approach and say well on the</p> <p>one hand we want to be reasonably</p> <p>conservative and try to get solid</p> <p>reviews of our proposed governance</p> <p>mechanism and/or use governance</p> <p>mechanisms that already exist in real</p> <p>life and that we have some idea will</p> <p>probably work okay with the other prong</p> <p>being try it out as much as possible on</p> <p>test nets that actually have value</p> <p>before we put it on to a network that</p> <p>has lots of value potentially and this</p> <p>is you know where the edgeware project</p> <p>could be very helpful and potentially</p> <p>others like it to really provide a</p> <p>network where you know no one's losing</p> <p>anything if it's if it there's no cost</p> <p>to it going down or being problematic or</p> <p>having to suffer a reversion but there</p> <p>is real value at stake</p> <p>because it's got tokens that are worth</p> <p>something</p> <p>and that's that I think is a really nice</p> <p>middle ground to sort of go and try a</p> <p>bunch of stuff that we think probably</p> <p>works okay but we can't be sure to</p> <p>really try you know empirical testing</p> <p>try it in real life in much the same way</p> <p>that when the psychologists want to run</p> <p>a new experiment you know they they get</p> <p>a bit of money and they sort of say look</p> <p>if you if you do this right you get</p> <p>fifty quid and you know this is the</p> <p>instructions offer you go kind of the</p> <p>same thing and we did something similar</p> <p>with the Olympic test net back in PRC</p> <p>nine PRC ten days for the theorem to try</p> <p>and get people to kick the tires of what</p> <p>would become the the main net before we</p> <p>released I actually I think Olympic was</p> <p>a not a failure but I don't think it was</p> <p>a great success not that many people</p> <p>took part in it and it didn't really it</p> <p>didn't discover it didn't uncover one or</p> <p>two of the books that came up which you</p> <p>know we would have otherwise hoped and I</p> <p>think a test net that has real value</p> <p>maybe less value than it would otherwise</p> <p>have but still real value is probably a</p> <p>much more market-oriented and therefore</p> <p>probably more successful way of of</p> <p>trying to incentivize people to to break</p> <p>it or otherwise test it</p> <p>yeah so I mean you know</p> <p>etherium had the consensus tests it had</p> <p>a decent first testing although I will</p> <p>note that when we implemented parity we</p> <p>found two points where the consensus</p> <p>test didn't cover and we had to we had</p> <p>to add new consensus test it's a hard</p> <p>thing to do with with substrate we kind</p> <p>of work around it a little bit by saying</p> <p>there's a single was a reference on</p> <p>chain so it's basically like a machine</p> <p>executable reference spec I think it's</p> <p>it's questionable whether that's such a</p> <p>great thing I mean the Bitcoin guys love</p> <p>that idea because it's like they've got</p> <p>their reference implementation Bitcoin</p> <p>core I kind of like the yellow paper for</p> <p>not being machine executable but yeah I</p> <p>mean in polka dot and substrates case it</p> <p>was largely forced upon us anyway</p> <p>in principle there could be multiple</p> <p>implementations at the same runtime I</p> <p>could you know that's something that I</p> <p>explicitly provide for in the versioning</p> <p>I'm not sure if it will happen the</p> <p>foundation the web sorry foundation is</p> <p>looking to fine teams that yeah cool</p> <p>okay yeah so I mean I'd like to see it</p> <p>happen but as for whether as for whether</p> <p>we could really come out come up with</p> <p>better consensus tests than what we have</p> <p>for theorem I'm not sure it's a really</p> <p>tough thing to do without literally</p> <p>paying someone to painstakingly go</p> <p>through the specification every single</p> <p>conditional write a test for and I mean</p> <p>this gets potential exponentially</p> <p>complex as the different modules I mean</p> <p>you're looking at kind of two to the</p> <p>number of conditions potential number of</p> <p>tests that would have to cover</p> <p>everything it's it's crazy so I would</p> <p>probably just go for</p> <p>taking out a month's rental of a</p> <p>supercomputer and running a huge amount</p> <p>of first test I think with a with a</p> <p>well-designed for sir that that should</p> <p>probably provide as much protection as</p> <p>as you would otherwise get in polkadot</p> <p>so there's there is a mechanism sperm</p> <p>free transactions basically for</p> <p>transactions under the substrate model</p> <p>which polkadot adheres to transactions</p> <p>must sorry under the substrate the SR ml</p> <p>model which polka dot adheres to I</p> <p>should say transactions must pay for</p> <p>their space on the chain so there's a</p> <p>fixed fee for a transaction and there's</p> <p>always I mean can set it to zero if you</p> <p>want but you know in principle there's a</p> <p>fixed fee that a chain can leverage and</p> <p>this is a something that can be changed</p> <p>and upgraded and all the rest of its if</p> <p>it's the parameter and there's also a</p> <p>per byte fee that's charged per byte of</p> <p>the transaction and as it's encoded on</p> <p>the chain so that's non negligible</p> <p>that's sorry that's non-negotiable they</p> <p>have to be paid beyond that there is an</p> <p>if you want to charge additional fees</p> <p>for what the transaction is doing then</p> <p>that's up to the chain and the runtime</p> <p>modules and the sort of the the code</p> <p>that you're writing yourself you can</p> <p>charge for what you want polka dot will</p> <p>probably have some yeah fees associated</p> <p>with the creation of balances with the</p> <p>occasion of accounts so the balances</p> <p>module has a fee schedule that you can</p> <p>again customize if you've depending on</p> <p>you know how much you want to charge for</p> <p>the sorts of things of creating new</p> <p>accounts reaping all the counts</p> <p>transferring balances as a bunch of</p> <p>things that you can</p> <p>customize what else other modules I</p> <p>think most modules actually don't</p> <p>specify much of a much of a fee schedule</p> <p>because most of the modules are yeah</p> <p>there are the governance modules do have</p> <p>a fairly complex system of deposits</p> <p>that's mainly to address sort of a game</p> <p>theoretic concern of a potential</p> <p>quadratic quadratic attacks where</p> <p>quadratic cost attacks where certain</p> <p>algorithms are order N squared to rent</p> <p>or order MN to run and you have to make</p> <p>sure that you know m and n can't both</p> <p>get too big it's ok if one of them gets</p> <p>kind of big but you need to make sure</p> <p>that they can't both get too big</p> <p>otherwise you end up sort of going off</p> <p>off into the distance in terms of the</p> <p>cost and that's managed through as I say</p> <p>a set of deposits and basically</p> <p>incrementally increasing the cost of one</p> <p>or the other depending on how big the</p> <p>other one is I think that's probably</p> <p>about it I'm not so worried about</p> <p>literally charging every single clock of</p> <p>processing like gas would do partly</p> <p>because a lot of a lot of operations are</p> <p>order one and/or they have like a</p> <p>reasonable maximum that is not that you</p> <p>know they don't really go proportional</p> <p>the user can't force or the trans actor</p> <p>can't force a anything over a particular</p> <p>maximum that maximum is relatively and</p> <p>significant and I would look upon it</p> <p>more or less as the Bitcoin chain does</p> <p>where it's fine</p> <p>basically to just charge for space on</p> <p>the chain for the size of the</p> <p>transaction and not think too much about</p> <p>the processing costs because they will</p> <p>be dwarfed by the storage costs</p> <p>obviously in smart contract land it's</p> <p>much more important to charge for the</p> <p>for everything because you know users</p> <p>can potentially write infinite loops and</p> <p>all the rest of it so their contracts</p> <p>module does indeed make sure that</p> <p>there's a proper costing mechanism for</p> <p>them</p> <p>it's not a final design decision to be</p> <p>honest but part of the reason is that it</p> <p>makes a lot of sense when block</p> <p>production is on a individual basis like</p> <ul> <li>so - are competing with each other   to</li> </ul> <p>produce these blocks it's not really the</p> <p>case in the consensus are mechanisms or</p> <p>block production mechanisms that I see</p> <p>substrate working under you in in</p> <p>substrates case that's really more of a</p> <p>sort of collective thing and it doesn't</p> <p>really make sense to reward one over</p> <p>another and partly it's I guess remember</p> <p>the other reason I think there was</p> <p>so in some sense when you burn fees it's</p> <p>a little like paying all of the other</p> <p>participants I guess yeah okay so the</p> <p>reason that that miners collected fees</p> <p>in etherium was because that's what they</p> <p>did in Bitcoin and the reason that -</p> <p>collected fees in Bitcoin was because</p> <p>eventually the block reward was going to</p> <p>go down to zero and that would be the</p> <p>only thing that incentivized - to do</p> <p>anything that's not the case in in</p> <p>polka-dot in poker ah the the validators</p> <p>are are incentivized like permanently</p> <p>through the reward system it basically</p> <p>means though dilution will happen there</p> <p>they're sort of percent or their ratio</p> <p>of their state compared to everyone else</p> <p>will remain the same they're sort of</p> <p>dilution protected and everyone else</p> <p>gets everyone who's not part of the</p> <p>validation nomination sort of system</p> <p>will get diluted and because that's in</p> <p>place it doesn't make so much sense to</p> <p>then</p> <p>reward them extra for for the</p> <p>transaction fees that said it's not a</p> <p>final decision as I said and I'm like</p> <p>you know something to talk about over</p> <p>the next few months and see if there's a</p> <p>compelling reason yeah I mean</p> <p>potentially I'm not sure we really see</p> <p>that in in real life there's plenty of</p> <p>instances where you know aetherium</p> <p>transactions go through four zero gas</p> <p>price censorship you know as always can</p> <p>always happen you know it's just if</p> <p>you're going out of your way to censor</p> <p>some transactions there's a cost</p> <p>associated that selection mechanism and</p> <p>that cost may be insignificant but that</p> <p>cost may be the price you're willing to</p> <p>pay maybe and it may be substantially</p> <p>greater than the cost of you know not</p> <p>collecting a couple of micro sense of</p> <p>fees so for sure but if they do then</p> <p>adding a small transaction fee isn't</p> <p>really going to make much difference</p> <p>unless unless you know the transactions</p> <p>that they're dealing with our micro</p> <p>transactions in which case</p> <p>yeah yeah I mean that's it so staking is</p> <p>more of a sort of collective pursuit</p> <p>rather than something cutthroat yeah I</p> <p>got a feeling there was another reason</p> <p>but I can't remember what it was now but</p> <p>as I say it's not something that I'm</p> <p>happy for this to be a continuing</p> <p>conversation and you know if it turns</p> <p>out that it does make sense for the</p> <p>block producer to to take these fees</p> <p>then this point is just the simplest</p> <p>code like I don't it's one line of code</p> <p>for you basically</p> <p>suppose you have 20% of the chain that</p> <p>is 20% of the total capital contained on</p> <p>the chain total tokens that is part of</p> <p>the staking system and market the market</p> <p>effects are such that 5% of that 20% so</p> <p>the total are being replicated to root</p> <p>for their rewards so I mean this is a</p> <p>half the reward right 25 percent but</p> <p>whatever then in order to prevent the</p> <p>rich get richer situation of the chain</p> <p>where validators just everyone gets</p> <p>diluted and all of that dilution is</p> <p>favoring the validators their percentage</p> <p>of the total state just keeps going up</p> <p>and up and up and up until eventually</p> <p>their total of the amount of the chain</p> <p>approach is like 100 percent to avoid</p> <p>that situation we place a well if we</p> <p>save 20 to 80 then we place an according</p> <p>amount so for X in our 20 to 80 ratio of</p> <p>the amount of that reward goes into a</p> <p>pot right so</p> <p>so we've got 20% a quarter of that gets</p> <p>paid to the to the validators so we're</p> <p>going to mint 25% of of the chains</p> <p>tokens again yep so we're going to</p> <p>dilute by 25% we take a fifth of that</p> <p>so validators whatever so that's that</p> <p>and with the other 20% which which</p> <p>basically is \u2155 of 80</p> <p>sorry \u00bc of 84 fits over 25 that gets</p> <p>placed into a sort of community Dow for</p> <p>the chain not too dissimilar from you</p> <p>know the thing on - or or even like the</p> <p>Dow although let's boogie hopefully and</p> <p>that will be used as like there's</p> <p>already a treasury module in here it's</p> <p>very simple but there's the treasury</p> <p>module actually sort of put forward ways</p> <p>of spending and and they can be voted on</p> <p>and then the idea is to basically allow</p> <p>additional modules to spend money from</p> <p>this pot and they can be sort of</p> <p>integrated through chain upgrades it</p> <p>could also be a lottery it can also be a</p> <p>reward for people that like accounts</p> <p>that are willing to bet on the price</p> <p>going up if you got an oracle feed of</p> <p>the price so if you're willing to bet</p> <p>that the price goes up and the price</p> <p>does indeed go up after a period of time</p> <p>then then you can get paid from this pot</p> <p>and if it goes down then you can your</p> <p>money gets put into the pot so there's</p> <p>all sorts of interesting don't think</p> <p>about that too hard there's all sorts of</p> <p>interesting oh yeah you can like what I</p> <p>showed you like the thing is what I was</p> <p>trying to think of a toy runtime module</p> <p>that would extol like that I could code</p> <p>live you know that wasn't so big that I</p> <p>couldn't code live but also that sort of</p> <p>got across</p> <p>a degree of sort of generality that this</p> <p>provides and unfortunately everything</p> <p>that you can code live pretty much will</p> <p>look like a smart contract because smart</p> <p>contracts are just tiny little bits of</p> <p>code that you add to block chains but</p> <p>what I did with with the extra module</p> <p>although it looked a bit like a smart</p> <p>contract it worked very differently</p> <p>right this this was a deployment of code</p> <p>that would be run natively and that</p> <p>would sit in principle in the same place</p> <p>as the smart contract as the smart</p> <p>contract bit of the etherium state</p> <p>transition function or the EVM or</p> <p>whatever else you want to think about</p> <p>code I won't even consider coding an EVM</p> <p>interpreter as a smart contract that</p> <p>would just be zany right I'll just be</p> <p>Cray would run so slow and it'd be</p> <p>really horrible but you could do that in</p> <p>one of these modules because it operates</p> <p>at like a 10 X low lower level so you</p> <p>get that 10 X in in performance and in</p> <p>well it uses that it uses some substrate</p> <p>runtime module for its pyro change</p> <p>management yeah I don't call it</p> <p>delegation because that's kind of got a</p> <p>loaded meaning now that EOS uses it in</p> <p>particular when you delegate a stake you</p> <p>don't get punished if the if the party</p> <p>that you delegate to misbehaves</p> <p>and that's usually problematic in terms</p> <p>of getting incentive correctness so we</p> <p>call it nominating and they're critical</p> <p>as I say the critical difference is that</p> <p>when you nominate a validator with your</p> <p>stake they you lose your stake if they</p> <p>misbehave I mean they lose those first</p> <p>but if they don't have enough to pay for</p> <p>the misbehavior then you lose yours</p> <p>yeah yeah so you this is to get around</p> <p>the nothing at stake issue long term</p> <p>long range attack yeah so yeah there's</p> <p>it it's bonded the moment the assumption</p> <p>is it'll be about three months bonding</p> <p>period but it will be at least as big as</p> <p>the expected period between releases of</p> <p>the of the binary of any software that</p> <p>sort of interprets this chain so no the</p> <p>assumption is that the most recent</p> <p>checkpoint will go into the software</p> <p>itself and the bonding period is</p> <p>sufficiently large that and the software</p> <p>will be released sufficiently frequently</p> <p>that the most recent bond most recent</p> <p>software release will be holding current</p> <p>validators currently bonded validators</p> <p>to account okay Sagan you can if you put</p> <p>it in yourself I use fixed point for</p> <p>anything that needs point one more if</p> <p>you're a move floating point then it's</p> <p>deterministic cool okay I call an end to</p> <p>this are you do you want to do it you</p> <p>wanna do the

While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies; in fact, many administrative operations, fintech procedures, and everyday services that can only be done offline and/or in person, can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services. What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts, as in the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. E-voting on the other hand, is another trending, yet critical, topic related to the online services. The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use e-voting systems.

They may vote either 1(known) or 0 (not yet known).</p> <p>Validity: is the parachain block valid and is all externally-referenced data (e.g. transactions).

One more possible direction is to enlist public participation in the process through a micro-complaints system.

A (this may be represented by Validators in the basic form of the protocol).</p> <p>Availability guarantors will mostly aim to maintain a stable connection to each other and to validators.</p> <p>A final route would be to nominate a second set of bonded validators as \"availability guarantors\".</p> <p>Unlike normal validators, they would not switch between parachains but rather would form a single group to attest to the availability of all important interchain data. This has the advantage of relaxing the equivalence between participants and chains.</p> <p>Overweight Blocks. If a validator set is compromised, they may create and propose a block which though valid, takes an inordinate amount of time to execute and validate. This is a problem since a validator group could reasonably form a block which takes a very long time to execute unless some particular piece of information is already known allowing a short cut, e.g. factoring a large prime. If a single collator knew that information, then they would have a clear advantage in getting their own candidates accepted as long as the others were busy processing the old block. We call these blocks overweight.</p> <p>To ensure validators can predict when they may be proposing an overweight block, it may be sensible to require them to publish information on their own performance for each block.</p> <p>Collator Insurance. One issue remains for validators: unlike with PoW networks, to check a collator\u2019s block for validity, they must actually execute the transactions in it. Malicious collators can feed invalid or overweight blocks to validators causing them grief and exacting a potentially substantial opportunity cost.</p> <p>To mitigate this, we propose a simple strategy on the part of validators. Firstly, parachain block candidates sent to validators must be signed from a relay chain account with funds; if they are not, then the validator should drop it immediately.</p> <p>Collator Preferences.

No. The goal of Polkadot is to provide a framework under which new blockchains may be created and to which existing blockchains can, if their communities desire, be transitioned.</p> <p>Is Polkadot designed to replace (insert crypto-currency here)? No. Polkadot tokens are neither intended nor designed to be used as a currency. They would make a bad currency: most will remain illiquid in the staking system and those that are liquid will face substantial fees for transfer of ownership. Rather, the purpose of Polkadot tokens is to be a direct representation of stake in the Polkadot network.</p> <p>What is the inflation rate for Polkadot staking tokens? The Polkadot staking token base expansion is unlimited. It rises and lowers according to market effects in order to target a particular proportion of tokens held</p> <p>under long-term bond in the validation process.</p> <p>Why does staking token ownership reflect stakeholding? This is a mechanism realised by the fact that they underpin the network\u2019s security. As such their value is tied to the overall economic value that Polkadot provides. Any actors who gain overall value from Polkadot operating correctly are incentivised to ensure it continues to do so. The best means of doing so is to take part in the validation process.

The chain emits events for pieces of information that are intrinsic to the chain itself.

For example, it is implemented as the mechanism to auction human readable names on the\u00a0ENS. The Candle auction is another solution that does not need the two-step commit and reveal schemes (a main component of Vickrey auctions), and for this reason allows smart contracts to participate.</p> <p>Polkadot will use a\u00a0random beacon\u00a0based on the VRF that's used also in other places of the protocol. The VRF will provide the base of the randomness, which will retroactively determine the end-time of the auction.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Slot Action compatition(Weekly)</p> </li> <li> <p>if Won then</p> </li> <li> <p>Parachain Lease Relay chain (Yearly)</p> </li> </ol> <p>The slot durations are capped to 1 year and divided into 6-week periods(KSM- 12m/3m=4m); The slot durations are capped to 2 years and divided into 3-month periods\u00a0(DOT- 24m/3m=8m);Once the parachain lease ends (48 weeks maximum on Kusama, 96 weeks on Polkadot), funds are returned to the contributors.</p> <p>Parachains may lease a slot for any combination of periods of the slot duration. Parachains may lease more than one slot over time, meaning that they could extend their lease to Polkadot past the maximum duration by leasing a contiguous slot.</p> <p>Note: Individual parachain slots are fungible. This means that parachains do not need to always inhabit the same slot, but **as long as a parachain inhabits any slot it can continue as a parachain.**You Can\u2019t (Technically) Combine Crowdloans and Private Bids</p> <p>Each period of the range 1 - 4 represents a 3-month duration for a total of 2 years.</p> <p>Bidders will submit a configuration of bids specifying the token amount they are willing to bond and for which periods. The slot ranges may be any of the periods 1 -\u00a0n, where\u00a0n\u00a0is the number of periods available for a slot (n\u00a0will be 8 for both Polkadot and Kusama).</p> <p></p> <p>highest bidder for any given slot lease period might not always win (see the\u00a0example below).</p> <p>There is one parachain slot available.</p> <p>Charlie bids\u00a075\u00a0for the range 1 - 8.</p> <p>Dave bids\u00a0100\u00a0for the range 5 - 8.</p> <p>Emily bids\u00a040\u00a0for the range 1 - 4.</p> <p>Let's calculate each bidder's valuation according to the algorithm. We do this by multiplying the bond amount by the number of periods in the specified range of the bid.</p> <p>Charlie - 75\u00a0*\u00a08 = 600 for range 1 - 8</p> <p>Dave - 100\u00a0*\u00a04 = 400 for range 5 - 8</p> <p>Emily - 40\u00a0*\u00a04 = 160 for range 1 - 4</p> <p>Although Dave had the highest bid in accordance to token amount, when we do the calculations we see that since he only bid for a range of 4, he would need to share the slot with Emily who bid much less. Together Dave's and Emily's bids only equals a valuation of\u00a0560.</p> <p>A random number, which is based on the VRF used by Polkadot, is determined at each block. Additionally, each auction will have a threshold that starts at 0 and increases to 1. The random number produced by the VRF is examined next to the threshold to determine if that block is the end of the auction within the so-called\u00a0ending period.</p> <p>Charlie's valuation for the entire range is\u00a0600. Therefore Charlie is awarded the complete range of the parachain slot.</p> <p>While each parachain auction is scheduled for seven days, the candle auction format means that the \u201cend\u201d date and time is a bit of a wildcard.</p> <p></p> <p>The first two days\u00a0are confirmed to be an \u201copen\u201d period of the auction.</p> <p>The following five days,\u00a0however, fall within the \u201cwick\u201d of this theoretical candle, and the auction will end sometime in this five-day period.\u00a0\u00a0so you won\u2019t actually know in real-time when the auction ends.</p> <p>project must specify the following information:</p> <p>Parachain ID/Index (which parachain the bid or crowdloan will support)</p> <p>First and Last Slot (the lease is broken into 8 increments, and projects can bid on a partial or full lease period)</p> <p></p> <p>While these crowdloan bids occur, the private-bid projects (Turquoise/Salmon) don\u2019t have to enter additional bids. However, after Day 2, it becomes risky to wait since the auction can end at any time.</p> <p>Finally, on Day 4, Salmon Parachain enters a private bid of 5000 DOT and briefly takes the lead in the auction.</p> <p>Unfortunately, on Day 5, Salmon Parachain is quickly outbid by a private bid from Turquoise Parachain AND an increased bid from the Purple Parachain crowdloan module.</p> <p>These antics continue until Day 7 when the highest bid is Purple Parachain with 18,000 DOT. However, importantly, Purple does not win. The winner is Turquoise.</p> <p>Turquoise Parachain wins the slot and is now able to connect to the Kusama network. This will likely happen soon after the slot is won since the lease period begins immediately. After the end of a lease period (48 week periods on Kusama and 96 week lease periods on Polkadot), the slot will be available for renewal or for another project to occupy.</p> <p>The remaining parachains must continue to compete for a slot, assuming their crowdloan modules remain open and the private bidders have the interest in pursuing a slot again, rather than waiting for a less competitive auction.</p> <p>Unbonding takes 28 days on Polkadot and\u00a07 on Kusama.

For instance, as a Cybersecurity Architect, I successfully designed secure, scalable solutions like microservices platforms and APIs for high-demand systems, achieving a *5% cost reduction* while driving *9% customer growth*. My strategic work is also bolstered by my contributions to cybersecurity research, including publishing papers on topics such as Cloud Computing, Blockchain, and Ransomware Detection Systems, as well as authoring a book titled *\"Rust as a Modern Mother Lang: Advanced Techniques for Developing Robust Apps.\"*  **Consulting Engagements**  I specialize in actionable, scalable cybersecurity consulting services for software engineering, IT, and security teams. My methodology prioritizes **resilience** and **confidentiality** using event/data-driven techniques embedded in modern frameworks such as **Penetration testing** and **Security Chaos Engineering**. These approaches reduce the complexity of building decision trees to model adverse effects, streamlining how organizations predict, contain, and recover from emerging threats.  During my consulting engagements, I\u2019ve delivered measurable impact. As a Cybersecurity Researcher, my security assessments reduced client risks by *30%* across over 100 penetration tests. Similarly, in my role as a Cybersecurity Engineer, I fortified critical infrastructure\u2014such as systems integral to the electricity sector\u2014while cutting management costs by *20%*.    I also guide organizations in leveraging containerized workflows and cloud-native tools, helping them improve project efficiency and operational scalability without compromising security. Collaborating hand-in-hand with both security and DevOps teams, I ensure seamless alignment to maintain agility while embedding safety as a cornerstone of operations.  Drawing from my background as an IT Technical Architect and experienced programmer, I deliver complex topics in an approachable manner, translating technical challenges into actionable strategies for stakeholders at all levels. I tailor my expertise to meet mission-critical organizational goals.

An unsanitized <code>poller_id</code> parameter pairs with the <code>action</code> parameter (<code>POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP</code>) to allow command injection through <code>proc_open</code>. Injection Initiation The vulnerability begins in the <code>poll_for_data()</code> function.

It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads. Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified #[[Kubernetes]] distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It works on bare-metal and virtualized servers. RKE solves the problem of installation complexity, a common issue in the Kubernetes community. With RKE, the installation and operation of Kubernetes is both simplified and easily automated, and it\u2019s entirely independent of the operating system and platform you\u2019re running. As long as you can run a supported version of Docker, you can deploy and run Kubernetes with RKE.Rancher has got [[CICD]] pipelines</p> <p></p> Quote <p>Rancher is a CaaS platform and service provider that you can use it on cloud or #air-gap #high-avalibility.

Keeping your attention on one project increases the likelihood you\u2019ll stay on track.</p> <p>The other thing you might want to try is deep work. An idea by Cal Newport, it\u2019s where you create an environment that lets you focus on that project for a certain amount of time (such as 1 hour or more) without distractions. Figure out when you\u2019re most productive. For me, it\u2019s in the morning before work. I wake up early, go through my routine, and then spend some time learning.</p> <p>Lastly, find tools to help you stay focused. I am a big fan of the Pomodoro Technique.

Then at the end of your project, see if those questions remain. If they do, start a new learning project and focus on answering those questions.</p> <p>As you can imagine, if you do this with a topic, you\u2019ll have several learning projects and soon start to develop expertise in this subject.

The best way to set this project up is by using Docker.  1. Pull down this repository and make sure you install each project's dependencies by running `npm run install`.  2. Ensure Docker is running then run `docker-compose up --build` to build the container, and images, and pull down the Postgres and nats images from Docker.  3. Verify that all services are up and running. The HTTP Server runs on port 3000.  # Application Structure  ## Features  - [x] Microservice Architecture - [x] Monorpo - [x] TypeORM - [x] CQRS - [x] JWT  ### HTTP API Gateway  This is a [hybrid application](https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/hybrid-application) that uses both HTTP and NATS as sources to listen to requests. This is the entry point to the entire platform. It forwards the request by publishing a message to the NATS server, and then the NATS server distributes it to its subscribers.  Any HTTP API endpoints should be defined in this project.  ### Orders Microservice  This is a sample microservice that has a createOrder event handler from the NATS server whenever it is triggered. It will create a order record and save it to the database.  ### Users Microservice  This is a user microservice that has a createUser event handler from the NATS server whenever it is triggered. It will create a user record and save it to the database.  # Monorepo  Config file for subprojects to build independent of the other projects or monorepo building.

This might be the first time we meet so I thought I\u2019d start this post off with a short introduction.</p> <p>I\u2019m Joe and previously I worked with JavaScript building web apps and mobile apps. Now, I\u2019m learning Rust both for personal reasons and work-related reasons. One of my primary focuses for this half of the year is Rust!</p> <p>Beyond that though, I am personally excited about Rust because:</p> <p>it\u2019s exciting it\u2019s type-safe (Yay, coming from TypeScript!) it\u2019s performant it has excellent documentation it has a strong community I dabbled a bit about a year ago doing some exercises on exercism but now learning Rust is a high priority.</p> <p>You might be interested in Rust because you can build: CLI tools Web apps (compile to WASM, or Web Assembly) Web servers And many other exciting things!</p> <p>For March, I decided to put together a plan to learn a little bit of Rust. The purpose is to start building projects with Rust and get involved in the community.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what the plan looks like:</p> <p>Learn enough Rust to be dangerous, measured by:</p> <p>ability to understand and explain basic concepts in Rust ability to contribute code to an open source project in the Rust community ability to build and ship a small project in Rust I\u2019ve taken these objectives and broken them out into actionable tasks. They are as follows:</p> <p>Read Chapters 1-3 of the Rust Lang Book (by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community) Write 3 blog posts Contribute to an open source project (bug fix or docs) Build a small web server app (bunny1 clone) This is the first blog post in the series, which covers my notes and thoughts on Chapter 1 of the Rust Lang Book. If you read Chapter 1 and would like to discuss, let\u2019s have a conversation! Tweet @ me or shoot me a DM on Twitter.</p> <p>Notes on Chapter 1 The first chapter in the Rust Lang Book is a friendly introduction to Rust. It covers enough of the basics to get started. You download Rust and then write your first program, which prints \u201cHello, World!\u201d Here are things I wrote down while reading the first chapter online:</p> <p>rustup is the preferred version manager Coming from the JavaScript world, I\u2019m used to scouring the internet for a decent node version manager. The common goto is nvm. Lucky for us, the Rust team supplies an official version manager and it\u2019s called rustup. Free, offline docs - out-of-the-box I noted this after rereading some of Chapter 1. rustup comes with a version of the docs that you can launch and read offline \ud83d\ude31 How genius is that?!</p> <p>rustup doc cargo commands are like npm commands Similar to how we use npm in the JS world for packaging and building our projects, cargo serves a similar purpose for Rust.</p> <p>Rust leans towards snake_case In JS, I used camelCase when naming things. It seems like the Rust community leans towards snake_case. This was evident during the hello world exercise. We named the project directory hello_world. My assumption may be premature.</p> <p>semicolons have meaning There is a great debate in JS - semicolons or no semicolons? While the choice is mainly conventional in JavaScript, Rust is a bit different. Most of the time, you\u2019ll use them to declare the end of an expression. Here\u2019s an example:</p> <p>// Rust example println!(\"Hello, world!\"); Like all good rules in programming languages, there is an exception! If you don\u2019t include it in a code block, it returns the last line. Here\u2019s what that looks like:</p> <p>// Rust if x &lt; 5 { x + 1 } There is no semicolon but this will still return x plus 1. Reminds me of the arrow function implicit return in JavaScript:</p> <p>// JavaScript const firstName = () =&gt; 'Rusty' Rust has an official code formatter If you\u2019re not familiar with the Prettier, it\u2019s an opinionated code formatter. It supports a lot of different languages. I believe it\u2019s the most used one in JavaScript. A positive note about Rust is that they have an official formatter called rustfmt. And even better, the Rust book says,</p> <p>The Rust team plans to eventually include this tool with the standard Rust distribution</p> <p>Official formatting - hooray! Another thing we don\u2019t have to worry about.</p> <p>Rust uses macros I wasn\u2019t familiar with this because JavaScript does not have them. They look like functions, but according to Computer Hope, macros are \u201ca tool that allows a developer to re-use code.\u201d I thought it was like a function, but they have a note saying,</p> <p>A macro is not the same as a function. Functions require special instructions and computational overhead to safely pass arguments and return values. A macro is a way to repeat frequently-used lines of code.</p> <p>Here is an example using the println! macro in Rust:</p> <p>// Rust println!(\"Howdy, friend!\"); The \u201c!\u201d in \u201cprintln!\u201d means it\u2019s a macro After learning about macros, I asked myself, \u201cBut how do you know if it\u2019s a local function vs. macro?\u201d Then I realized, it\u2019s the !. That\u2019s the pattern to look for.</p> <p>\u201cBinary executable\u201d is fancy terms for \u201ccomputer-ready-file\u201d I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cbinary executable.\u201d I know what \u201cbinary\u201d means and I know what \u201cexecutable\u201d means, but I highlighted this anyway. In layperson terms, it means the computer can read and execute it without anyone\u2019s help.</p> <p>Compile before you run, you must When I learned JavaScript, I never fully understood the whole compiled vs interpreted lingo. Well, now I have a basic understanding. In most cases, a JavaScript engine (like V8) \u201ccompiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.\u201d Notice though, the JS engine does this, not the developer.</p> <p>In Rust (and many other languages), there is a compile step that you, the developer, must do. So you must compile your code before you can run it.</p> <p>Ahead-of-time compilation is awesome I hadn\u2019t previously heard this phrase \u201cahead-of-time compilation\u201d but now I get what it is and why it\u2019s awesome. You compile your program and it outputs a file. Because you compiled \u201cahead of time\u201d \ud83d\ude09 you can send it to a friend who can then run it on their machine without having Rust. That\u2019s amazing! At least coming from JS/Python. With Rust, it\u2019s already ready to go!</p> <p>cargo new, what it do? Going back to our npm comparison, it is like npm init and creates a new Rust project. What makes it even better though is that it includes a .gitignore file for you. It\u2019s fantastic.</p> <p>crates are like npm packages Crates are bundled up pieces of code. Similar to the JS world, you install a package from npm, you do the same with Rust, but with crates. I love the term \u201ccrate.\u201d It\u2019s kind of fun to say and isn\u2019t an everyday term like \u201cpackages\u201d. The official crates registry is crates.io.</p> <p>The other differentiating factor is that crates.io is \u201cmanaged by members of the Crates.io and Rust core teams.\u201d I hope this means it\u2019s more sustainable and community-driven.</p> <p>Rust encourages project folder structure Coming from the JS world, you can put your files in any directory you want (most of the time). You then tell your bundler where to look. What I like about Rust is that it encourages a project folder structure out the gate. According to the book, \u201cCargo expects your source files to live inside the src directory.\u201d This is great! One less thing for us to think about. You can, of course, override this by setting the path value in your cargo.toml (I googled out of curiosity).</p> <p>cargo check - \u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d cargo check will check your source code without building it. This is a good way to iterate quickly.</p> <p>cargo build \u2014release - \u201cShip it!\u201d This one is more of a reminder for me. When you\u2019re ready to ship your code to production, add the release flag to your build step:</p> <p>cargo build --release fn: function keyword is only two letters In JavaScript, we have to use seven keystrokes to declare a function. That\u2019s a lot! But in Rust, we only need to write two: fn. How cool is that? We\u2019re five keystrokes richer in Rust.</p> <p>What\u2019s next? As previously mentioned, next up for me is Chapter 2 of the Rust Lang Book. Here, they\u2019ll walk us through programming a guessing game - hooray! I\u2019m excited about this.</p> <p>The next blog post in this series will cover my notes on building my first real project in Rust. Until then, happy coding my fellow Rustaceans! \ud83e\udd80</p> <p>P.S. - I included a glossary and cheatsheet at the end here.

In languages with null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null. In his 2009 presentation \u201cNull References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,\u201d Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say: I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.</p> <p>To program defensively, make use of the is_nan() and is_finite() methods. Inducing a crash, rather than silently proceeding with a mathematical error, allows you to debug close to what has caused the problem.

This book is divided into two volumes; the first volume covers introductory topics, language syntax, advanced memory management, unsafe code writing, pointers anatomy, and behavior patterns.

The process of increasing demand, the need for intelligent supply and demand cycle, better resource management, better utilization of resources is necessary. The results indicate competition from the cycle leads to a complex challenge for selecting and scheduling tasks to provide composite services in the cloud. One of the most important issues in this field is load balancing. How to choose idle resources from a set of resources, overcoming compositional constraints, determines the importance of scheduling and resource allocation. These are NP-Hard issues. State-of-the-art architecture in the field of cloud computing for the implementation of Scientific Workflows that can be implemented in a distributed manner is becoming increasingly considered in other sciences related to cloud computing. The distinction and competition of cloud service providers to publish services with more profit and better quality to customers are summarized in features such as \"Scalability, Stability, High availability, Fault tolerance\". By providing new solutions and services for using specialists in other sciences, we can see the utilization of cloud computing Infrastructure and services in the fields of industry, commerce, health, and emergency applications. The possibility of conducting scientific workflows using virtual machines\" and containers is a goal that has been addressed in the proposed architecture. The load balancing in the form of containers at the level of virtual machines using the ant colony optimization(ACO) algorithm is one of the important goals and issues that have been covered and solutions for utilization as much as possible has been explained. According to previous studies, there is no comprehensive or stable architecture that can balance scientific workflows using the algorithm ACO at the container virtualization level. By providing a simulator environment and testing several samples with different parameters then estimated the efficiency of the ACO and default algorithm of CloudSIM e.g., first-come-first-serve (FCFS). In the case of fifty, hundred samples of \"montage\" scientific workflow, which is considered as the average load rate, balancing the workload of the containers on the virtual machine with the ACO has better results than the FCFS. If the value of the beta parameter of the ACO is assigned by zero, the algorithm will be trapped to the local optimal. In the case of a thousand sample, which is interpreted as a large amount of workload, if a \"cybershake\" workflow is used finally the results will be the same in all performance evaluation indicators. The results indicate that on average, the ACO has desired performance of almost 50% better than FCFS in the most of scenarios regarding proposed architecture and using cybershake and montage workflows.</p> <p>Keywords: [[Cloud]]Computing, #ContainerAllocation, [[Workflow]], #ACO , [[Container]] Allocation, #DevOps, [[Load_Balancer]], [[Scheduler]]</p> Info <p>Getting Project-OpenSource</p> <pre><code> &lt;iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VIpOwOa1r9XPfNfGD7re6VazoJchVezn/preview\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" allow=\"autoplay\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Experimental Research: CloudSim-Workflow-Function-Container-Plus (Toward ServerMix)</p> <p>Pros:</p> <ul> <li> Simulation of cost and performance</li> <li> Scalability: Container is very scalable than the virtual machines</li> <li> Elasticity: with separating logical code and data</li> <li> Decrease overhead</li> <li> Decrease the start time of tasks</li> <li> Fixed data dependency</li> <li> Resource management</li> <li> Workflow Engine management</li> <li> Resource Management</li> </ul> <p>Cons:</p> <ul> <li> Lack of clean code and more refactoring.</li> <li> Exclude of design patterns, modular</li> <li> Not using Maven and Unit Test</li> </ul> <p>Concepts:</p> <ul> <li> Workflow: correspond with Function Composition on the simulation environment.</li> <li> Function as a Service(FaaS): Lambda or Cloud Function on the production environment.</li> <li> Cloudlet\u00a0: the task of the client or job of workflow</li> <li> ACO Scheduler: Ant colony optimization</li> <li> Serverfull: include virtual machine/on-premises</li> <li> Serverless: no server, Event-driven, Provisioning, Scalability, FaaS</li> <li> ServerMix:       : <code>The proposed model included both of them.
