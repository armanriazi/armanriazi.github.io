[![mkdocs-ci](https://github.com/armanriazi/armanriazi.github.io/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/armanriazi/armanriazi.github.io/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

I’ve always been driven by the idea of transforming complexity into clarity—building a comprehensive knowledge base for myself and then sharing it with others. This website embodies that vision, serving as a space to document insights, strategies, and lessons learned from my journey in programming and cybersecurity, secure system design, and modern software architecture.

The philosophy behind these pages is simple: to provide evidence-based guidance, practical methodologies, and actionable security strategies that help individuals and organizations navigate the rapidly evolving digital landscape. By sharing what I’ve learned—from implementing decentralized and distributed architectures to advancing research in areas like Ransomware detection and Security Chaos Engineering—I hope to empower others to tackle today’s challenges with confidence.
