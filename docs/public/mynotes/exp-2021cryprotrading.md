# Experience loss of money because of trading crypto in 2021 ðŸ¤•

> My friend and I used to engage in a financial plan, and we were responsible for paying 6% monthly interest to the investor, and then he lost USDT 73.000 because in 2021 everybody said bitcoin would be USDT 120.000â€“240.000, while he was supposed to sell at the price of USD 70.000, but it was not happening. We did not have a team for managing orders exactly and doing so based on our good and logical plan. This activity had psychological effects, but I tried to feel better by reading books, practising meditation, having patience, recovering my mind, etc.

> I wonder to let you know that USDT 73.000  is about the value of Rial 5.000.000.000 . It is really harmful in situations of instability in the economy of the country. So, I need to work seriously without wasting time to compensate for his losses. It is so hard for him to make a living as a loser! I must help him before he...

> Due to my interest in and experience with the blockchain, these things will still be worth something when I have finished paying off his debt! especially worthy of friendship.
