# Experience loss of money because of trading crypto in 2021 🤕

> My friend and I used to engage in a financial plan, and we were responsible for paying 6% monthly interest to the investor, and then he lost USDT 73.000 because in 2021 everybody said bitcoin would be USDT 120.000–240.000, while he was supposed to sell at the price of USD 70.000, but it was not happening. We did not have a team for managing orders exactly and doing so based on our good and logical plan. This activity had psychological effects, but I tried to feel better by reading books, practising meditation, having patience, recovering my mind, etc.

> I wonder to let you know that USDT 73.000 is about the value of Rial 5.000.000.000 . It is really harmful in situations of instability in the economy of the country. So, I need to work seriously without wasting time to compensate his losses. It is so hard for him to make a living as a loser in a country that is in recession! I must help him before he...

> Due to my interest in and experience with the blockchain, these things will still be worth something when I have finished paying off his debt! especially worthy of friendship.
