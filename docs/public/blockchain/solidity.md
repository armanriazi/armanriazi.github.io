Example of Decentralized Program - Voting



   The following example is made of blockchain using a point-to-point trading system. Each user buys a product with their Atrium MetaMask wallet, which leads to the deduction of the amount of Atrium in the buyer's wallet and at the same time is credited to the seller's account according to the smart contract. This sample does not follow the internal network in the previous sample It uses an atrium test network called Kovan.
