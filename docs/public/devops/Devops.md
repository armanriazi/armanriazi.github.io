??? quote
    I success to launched #Microservice  either of [[dotnetcore]] and a sample with python I captured 6h about implement of ci-cd with [[kubernetes]] and docker that I did not want upload it. For devOps you should better know a little bit about programing languages but it will be ok, if you do not know. e.g I have not write any code by python but I was able to [[[deploy]] it.For devops you need to know about configuration, esxi, on-permise, cloud, windows server, linux dist/ubuntu that is out of scope for now surely.
