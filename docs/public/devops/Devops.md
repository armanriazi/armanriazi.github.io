    I success to launched #Microservice  either of #dotnetcore and a sample with #python I captured 6h about implement of ci-cd with #kubernetes and docker that I did not want upload it. For devOps you should better know a little bit about programing languages but it will be ok, if you do not know. e.g I have not write any code by python but I was able to #deploy it.For devops you need to know about configuration, esxi, on-permise, cloud, windows server, linux dist/ubuntu that is out of scope for now surely.
