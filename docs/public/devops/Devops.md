??? quote

    I successfully launched a #Microservice using both [[dotnetcore]] and Python. I spent around 34 hours implementing CI/CD with [[kubernetes]] and Docker, but I did not want to upload it yet. In DevOps, it’s beneficial to have some knowledge of programming languages, although it will be okay if you do not know any. For example, I have not written any code in Python, but I was still able to [[deploy]] it. Additionally, you need to know about configuration management, ESXi, on-premises infrastructure, cloud, Windows Server, and Linux distributions like Ubuntu; but those topics are beyond the scope for now.
