I had a lot of fun making this a challenge for myself! I feel more motivated to continue contributing to Rust OSS 

What’s next?
Next up in my Ultralerning Plan is to:

build and ship a small project in Rust

I already built a small temperature converter suggested by the Rust Lang Book at the end of Chapter 3. However, for this particular goal, I assigned myself the task to “Build a small web server app (bunny1 clone).”

I already started on the project and have made solid progress. I still need to refactor a few pieces and ship it. After, I’ll share a blog post about how I built it and a link so you can check it out.

Thanks for reading! Happy coding my fellow Rustaceans! 🦀
