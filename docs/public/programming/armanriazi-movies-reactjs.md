> Improved speed and performance.

> I developed a sample-project base on #reactjs, #nodejs, #couchdb, #ibm ,and [[cloud]], on #heroku #pipline.

> I wanted to start work on reactjs that I think it has a main components include grid, list, search, connected to db. 

> I have got satisfied with mix of couchdb and reactjs! Why not! both of them are good choice for frontend and database with o/i json.
