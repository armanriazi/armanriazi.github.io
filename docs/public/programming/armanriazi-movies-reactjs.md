# armanriazi-movies-reactjs

[online: armanriazi-movies-reactjs.herokuapp](https://armanriazi-movies-reactjs.herokuapp.com/)

> Improved speed and performance.

> I developed a sample-project base on [[Reactjs]], [[Nodejs]], [[Couchdb]], [[IBM]] ,and [[Cloud]], on [[Heroku]] [[CICD]].

> I wanted to start work on reactjs that I think it has a main components include grid, list, search, connected to db. 

> I have got satisfied with mix of couchdb and reactjs! Why not! both of them are good choice for frontend and database with o/i json.
