 It's simply not acceptable to...

 Good point

 Keeping to the point

 That's not good at all.

 I'm not sure that's relevant

 I dunno

 To me, it's just total waste of [[time]]

 I am not #sure this module would go with it.

 You'll have to do better than that. I'm afraid.

 (From my point of view,/it seems to me that)There should be learning [[rather]] than coding.
